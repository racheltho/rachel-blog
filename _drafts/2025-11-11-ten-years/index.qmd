I wrote my very first blog post in 2015. I spent months researching it and refining my writing. I  was nervous to post it publicly, and then pleasantly shocked when it made the top 5 list for [Medium]() that day, front page of Hacker News, and a professor friend included it in the syllabus for one of her classes. Since then, I have written over 70 posts, spread across [Medium](https://medium.com/@racheltho), [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), and now rachel.fast.ai (I have ported many, but not all, of my older posts over here).  Writing online has helped me to meet new people with shared interests, resulted in invitations to speak at conferences, and led reporters to interview me.

Here, I though I would round up a few of my post popular posts over the past decade:

- [If you think women in tech is just a pipeline problem, you haven’t been paying attention](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2015-07-27-not-pipeline/) (2015): It doesn’t matter how many girls you teach to code if you keep driving adult women out of the tech industry.

- [Deep Learning: Not Just for Silicon]() (2017): a short post giving concrete examples 

- [How (and why) to create a good validation set](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2017-11-13-validation-sets/) (2017): Avoid machine learning failures from poorly chosen validation sets.

- [Trends to Avoid When Founding a Startup]() (2018): 

- [Google's AutoML: Cutting Through the Hype](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2018-07-23-automl3/) (2018): I analyze Google's claims that we all need customized, bespoke neural network architectures

- [Five Things That Scare Me About AI](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2019-01-29-five-scary-things/) (2019): An AI-powered future is already here, and some of the consequences are scarier than you may realize.

- [The Problem with Metrics is a Big Problem for AI](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2019-09-24-metrics/) (2019) : Unthinkingly optimizing metrics leads to serious harms, and what most current AI approaches do is to optimize metrics.

- [My family’s unlikely homeschooling journey](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2022-09-06-homeschooling/) (2022): My husband and I never expected to end up homeschooling, yet now we have committed to it long-term.

- [AI’s Quest to Predict T Cell Binding– The Holy Grail of Immunology](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-08-01-ai-t-cells/) (2024):
Different neural nets can be used to predict T cell binding, and it is unclear which is best.

- [Your Immune System is Not a Muscle](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-08-13-crowds-vs-friends/) (2024): Our immune systems evolved for a different world (that didn’t involve 100,000 global flights per day).

- [Deep learning gets the glory, deep fact checking gets ignored](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2025-06-04-enzyme-ml-fails/) (2025): When impressive AI biology results are full of errors

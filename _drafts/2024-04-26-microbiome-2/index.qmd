This is part 2 in a series.  Be sure to check out [part 1 here]().

## There is no clear "good" vs. "bad" for microbes

*Pseudomonas syringae* is a plant pathogen that is a scourge of agricultural crops.  It infects almost all economically valuable species of crops and [threatens global agriculture production](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5972017/).

But actually it’s not all bad – this same species of bacteria is important to weather precipitation cycles.  For temperatures above -40 degrees C, ice formation requires a catalyst, called an ice nucleator.  Researchers have discovered that [most ice nucleators are biological](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0809816105): tiny microbes that are widely dispersed throughout the atmosphere all over the world, even in Antarctica!  And it turns out that [*Pseudomonas syringae* is a common nucleator for catalyzing precipitation](https://www.activeremedy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/brent-christner_2012_cloudy-with-a-chance-of-microbes.pdf).  This example highlights the complexity of microbial ecosystems.  Efforts to protect plants from this pathogen must take into account the interrelated impact on precipitation.

Another example of a microbe that can’t be clearly classified as "good" or "bad" is *Prevotella Copri*, found in the human gut microbiome. An aptly titled paper, "The curious case of Prevotella copri” describes "puzzling discrepancies" in how various research studies have associated this species with a [range of positive and negative impacts on disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10478744/).

The authors share that high abundance of P. copri is associated with non-Western diets, rheumatoid arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis (a type of inflammatory arthritis), Graves’ orbitopathy (autoimmune condition that can damage vision vision), diabetes mellitus, and cancer.  This is particularly surprising, because several of the inflammatory and autoimmune conditions listed are more strongly associated with Western diets.  Low abundance of P. copri is associated with Western diets, glucose intolerance, chronic hives, Parkinson's disease, and food allergies.

It is unclear whether abundant *Prevotella copri* in the gut is good or bad. The paper notes that *P. copri* has a diverse set of strains, which differ from the reference strain, and may partly explain the discrepancies.  The ways that gut microbes interact with each other, our immune systems, and our genetics can be quite complex, and these factors may mediate how P. copri influences a person’s health.

## Microbes are everywhere

We’ve already seen how microbes in the atmosphere (including ones that act as plant pathogens) are necessary for catalyzing precipitation.  Microbes are also found in soil, smoke, and even on nanoplastics.

When I lived in California there were several years in which we had widespread wildfire smoke that was harmful to breathe, polluted the air, and created an eerie yellow hue.  I knew that smoke contains toxins, and I incorrectly assumed that it wouldn’t be a suitable habitat for anything living. Counter-intuitively, [smoke is a good habitat for some microbes](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe8116), as the particulate matter helps block UV rays that might otherwise kill them.  Water vapor produced by the combustion of biomass can help prevent microbes from drying out.  And convective columns and updraft winds can draw in microbes from long distances.

[One study on the California wildfires](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(23)00046-3/fulltext) found that hospitalizations for coccidioidomycosis, a dangerous fungal infection, increased by 20% in the month following smoke exposure. This is a worrying threat given that the climate crisis has led to increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires. There is even a nascent field of **pyroaerobiology**, studying the aerosolization and transport of [microbes by wildfires](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2507). 

The environmental harms of microplastics, tiny pieces of plastic less than 5mm in size, have been gaining more attention. Floating “islands” of plastic debris are found in the oceans and this pollution harms the aquatic life and sea birds that ingest it.  There are microbes that thrive on these microplastics, [forming the Plastisphere](https://doi.org/10.1890/150017).  Researchers have found that the Atlantic and Pacific oceans have distinct Plastisphere communities, and that these differences may necessitate different remediation approaches.  Unfortunately, this thin film of bacteria and fungi living on microplastics may make them more appealing to some of the sea animals that ingest the plastic. Researchers are also investigating how microbes can be used to break down these dangerous plastics.

## More to learn

Understanding the microbiome is a crucial piece of better understanding the health of plants, humans, and other animals, as well as our environment.  Microbes synthesize vitamins, catalyze precipitation, spread disease or protect from it, can remediate or exacerbate the impacts of pollution, and influence food chains. Only with relatively recent advances in genomic sequencing have we been able to better study and compare the balance of species composing different microbiomes.  This is a fascinating and growing area of research.

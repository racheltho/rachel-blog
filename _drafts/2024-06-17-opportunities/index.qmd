This December, I will graduate with an MS in Microbiology-Immunology. I am currently writing a literature review of how deep learning is being applied to immunology.  Applications include predicting T cell receptor binding, discovering new drugs, and mapping immune cell-cytokine relationships.

I am starting to look for what to do next. I am particularly interested in opportunities that involve a mix of research and science communication, and which can be done remotely. I love research, collating information, and explaining technical concepts to a more general audience.

What I have to offer:

* Knowledge of microbiology, immunology, deep learning, and AI ethics
* Great at collating and synthesizing knowledge from several academic fields
* Conscientious, detail-oriented, diligent
* Strong communicator, both through public speaking and scientific essays
* Fascinated by questions of how the immune system works and what goes wrong in autoimmune or chronic inflammatory disease. I am particularly interested in the role of viral infections in triggering other diseases.
* Straight As in graduate courses, including: Applied Immunology, Medical Microbiology, Biosecurity and Emerging Threats, The Microbiome, Bioinformatics, Applied Microbiology \& Virology
* Past track record:
	* Math PhD, completed in 2010, Duke University
	* Cofounder of fast.ai, which created the longest running deep learning course in the world
	* Designed and taught courses on Computational Linear Algebra, Natural Language Processing, and Data Ethics for the University of San Francisco MS in Data Science Program
	* Published 3 book chapters on data ethics

I enjoy being at the edge of new knowledge (whether that is in academia or industry) AND I also love communicating with a general audience.  I am fascinated by the immune system and wanting to understand how it works AND I enjoy data and code.

What Iâ€™m looking for:

* Curious and engaged teammates
* A mix of research and general science communication
* Workplace that values diversity
* Remote

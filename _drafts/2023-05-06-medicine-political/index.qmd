XXX - what is this? why are you writing it? why do i care?

The question of how to run a clinical trail might sound pretty snooze-worthy, but it turns out that finding new answers to this was at the heart of a scientific revolution that saved countless lives from the 1990's to today. A group of non-experts scrutinized complex academic literature and discovered that science was not, at that time, in a position to help their community as it was being ravaged by a new and poorly understood virus: AIDS. Their work is a powerful lesson in how medicine is political, and the harm this can cause.

## The AIDS Epidemic

By 1987, [40,000 Americans had died of AIDS](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/09/689924838/how-to-demand-a-medical-breakthrough-lessons-from-the-aids-fight) and there were 5-10 million HIV infections globally. However, many people considered AIDS to be only a problem for gay men and drug-users, two heavily stigmatized populations.  Politicians, such as President Ronald Reagan, were hesitant to even say the word "AIDS" publicly or acknowledge the epidemic. Due to this stigma, there was little urgency and miniscule funding for prevention, research, and treatments related to HIV/AIDS. Activists formed the group ACT UP, using a multi-pronged approach combining controversial, attention-grabbing protests with concrete scientific proposals. The group had a [Treatment and Data Committee](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/14/how-act-up-changed-america), whose members read immunology and virology textbooks and became experts in how drug trials are run. 

Lacking a sense of urgency, those working at the FDA and NIH preferred to follow the standard, slow approach to clinical trials. However, young people were dying of AIDS at an alarming rate, and the situation called for new methods of treatment development. Of the hundreds of protests organized by ACT UP, a particularly pivotol one occurred in October 1988, when 1,500 ACT UP activists attempted to "Seize the FDA", blocking all entrances to the building.  They laid down with tombstones reading “Killed by the FDA” and hung banners from the FDA reading “Silence = Death.” The protest had been meticulously planned for months in advance, and was accompanied by [detailed, science-based demands](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/before-occupy-how-aids-activists-seized-control-of-the-fda-in-1988/249302/) on how the FDA could change its process for clinical trials in order to fast-track access to experimental drugs for patients facing near-certain death.

XXX move this. The work of ACT UP changed how clinical trials are conducted, with a move away from testing drugs on small groups of people for a long period of time, to instead test on a large group of people for a much shorter time period. Their advocacy also [resulted in the use of “surrogate endpoints”](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/01/world-aids-day-how-aids-activists-changed-medical-research), such as T cell counts and viral loads, which can be obtained faster than the traditional approach of waiting for clinical results of patient well-being.  The work of ACT UP saved countless lives, and the huge progress that has happened in HIV/AIDS research and treatment would not have happened without these efforts.

On the surface, how to structure and run a clinical trial may seem like a purely scientific question.  Yet as seen with AIDS drug trials, scientific research is deeply shaped by history and politics, culture and stigma, funding and opportunity, and values around whose viewpoints matter. Scientists often like to think of their work as perfectly objective and perfectly rational, but science does not just progress inevitably.  It is deeply dependent on the above factors.

XXX expand or move or delete this - When scientists fail to acknowledge the reality that there is no “view from nowhere”, they can miss their own blindspots and even make themselves vulnerable to bad-faith attacks. Sadly, this has happened over the past few decades in debates about climate change. As one [climate scientist recounted](https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/status/1442207481330114567?s=20), “We spent a long time thinking we were engaged in an argument about data and reason, but now we realize it's a fight over money and power… They [climate change deniers] focused their lasers on the science and like cats we followed their pointer and their lead.”  

## Medicine's History

XXX Modern medicine tends to be presented as perfect scientific objectivity. Scores of examples show this couldn't be further from the truth.
XXX rewrite and expand examples - The myth of perfect scientific objectivity positions modern medicine as completely distinct from a history where women were diagnosed with “hysteria” (roaming uterus) for a variety of symptoms, where Black men were denied syphilis treatment for decades as part of a “scientific study”, and [multiple sclerosis was](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/10/guardian-australias-book-club-why-does-medicine-care-so-little-about-womens-bodies) “called hysterical paralysis right up to the day they invented a CAT scan machine” and demyelination (damage to the nerve linings) could be seen on brain scans.

XXX clunky wording; expand these examples too - However, there is not some sort of clean break where bias was eliminated and all unknowns were solved. Black patients, [including children](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26366984/), still receive [less pain medication](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-doctors-can-confront-racial-bias-in-medicine/) than white patients for the same symptoms. Women are still more likely to have their physical symptoms dismissed as psychogenic. Nearly half of women with autoimmune disorders report being [labeled as "chronic complainers"](https://psmag.com/social-justice/is-medicines-gender-bias-killing-young-women) by their doctors in the 5 years (on average) they spend seeking a diagnosis.  All this impacts what data is recorded in their charts, what symptoms are counted.

## The covid pandemic

XXX segue using mention of HIV - there's been a new viral pandemic since then, and we're seeing similar problems. maybe also mention similar solution of patient-led research and advocacy?

In early 2020, [patients with other post-viral illnesses](https://twitter.com/jenbrea/status/1238988538844033024?s=20) warned of the potential long-term consequences of a covid infection, even as many pundits assured the public that the "young and healthy" would be fine.  Evidence soon started accumulating that covid was not solely a respiratory illness, but that a variety of organ systems could be impacted long-term: [cognitive dysfunction](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51350) and [deficits](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00324-2/fulltext), XXX [GI immune system damage](https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/4/698), [immune dysfunction](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21257759v1), [increased risk of kidney outcomes](https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/early/2021/08/25/ASN.2021060734), and [increased risk of diabetes](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266809).

Dealing with tens of millions of newly disabled people would be very expensive for governments, social service programs, private insurance companies, and others. Thus, many have a significant financial interest in distorting the science around long term effects of covid to minimize the perceived impact. While the exact percentage of cases that lead to long covid has been hotly debated, even a "small" percentage of the huge number of total covid cases is quite large. An [article from mid-2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-06/long-covid-patients-will-drain-u-s-disability-funding) warned, “If only 10% of the 34 million Americans that were affected by Covid-19 get long-haul symptoms and try to apply for these [disability] services, our system that is already overwhelmed and underfunded is going to collapse...”  [Note: far more than 34 million Americans have had covid in the 2 years since then.] XXX but they system didn't collapse, so this was unnecessary panic?

## Parallels with climate change denialism

XXX tell us about the climate denial playbook - Since 2020, there have been concerted efforts to downplay the long-term health effects of covid using strategies straight out of the [climate denial playbook](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154621000474?via%3Dihub), such as [funding contrarian scientists](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/09/13/covid-19-and-the-new-merchants-of-doubt/), [misleading petitions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/herd-immunity-letter-signed-fake-experts-dr-johnny-bananas-covid), [social media bots](https://fas.org/blogs/fas/2020/10/social-media-conversations-in-support-of-herd-immunity-are-driven-by-bots/), and disingenuous debate tactics that make the science seem murkier than it is. In many cases, these [minimization efforts are being funded](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/09/13/covid-19-and-the-new-merchants-of-doubt/) by the [same billionaires](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/tory-billionaire-bankrolled-herd-immunity-scientist-who-advised-pm-against-lockdown/) and institutions that fund climate change denialism. 

XXX did herd immunity work out?
The American Institute for Economic Research (AIER), a libertarian think tank funded by right wing billionaire Charles Koch, which invests in fossil fuels, energy utilities, and tobacco, is well known for its research denying the climate crisis.  In October 2020, the AIER hosted a private retreat where a document called the [Great Barrington Declaration (GBD)](https://theconversation.com/5-failings-of-the-great-barrington-declarations-dangerous-plan-for-covid-19-natural-herd-immunity-148975) was developed, calling for a “herd immunity” approach to covid and suggesting that young, healthy people have little to worry about. The three scientists who authored the GBD have prestigious pedigrees and are politically well-connected, speaking to White House Officials and having found favor in the British government. A study in 2020 found that [half of the social media](https://fas.org/blogs/fas/2020/10/social-media-conversations-in-support-of-herd-immunity-are-driven-by-bots/) accounts advocating for herd immunity seem to be bots, characterized as engaging in abnormally high levels of retweets & low content diversity. [An article in the BMJ](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/09/13/covid-19-and-the-new-merchants-of-doubt/) advised that it is “critical for physicians, scientists, and public health officials to realize that they are not dealing with an orthodox scientific debate, but a well-funded sophisticated science denialist campaign based on ideological and corporate interests.”

## Data can be missing, biased, and incorrect

XXX move down and justify this first - Medical data are not objective truths. Like all data, the context is critical. [It can be missing, biased, and incorrect](https://bostonreview.net/science-nature/rachel-thomas-medicines-machine-learning-problem).  It is filtered through the opinions of doctors.  Even blood tests and imaging scans are filtered through the decisions of what tests to order, what types of scans to take, what accepted guidelines recommend, what technology currently exists. And the technology that exists depends on research and funding decisions stretching back decades, influenced by politics and cultural context. 

XXX start with some examples, and then describe what's happening
A self-fulfilling prophecy can occur if doctors:

1. label a new, poorly understood, multi-system disease as psychogenic,
2. use this as justification to not invest much funding into researching physiological origins, 
3. and then point to the lack of evidence as a reason why the illness must be psychogenic. 

XXX this is long and boring - This is largely the experience of ME/CFS patients over the last several decades. Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), involves dysfunction of the immune system, autonomic systems, and [energy metabolism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32041178/). While this dysfunction can be captured in quantitative tests (such as a [2 day cardiac pulmonary exertion test](https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Two-day_cardiopulmonary_exercise_test)), the tests are expensive, non-standard, and hard to access. ME/CFS is [more debilitating](https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203173#ref019) than many chronic diseases, including chronic renal failure, lung cancer, stroke, and type-2 diabetes. ME/CFS is often triggered by viral infections, so it is not surprising that we are seeing some [overlap between ME/CFS and long covid](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.698169/full). ME/CFS disproportionately impacts women, and a [now discredited 1970 paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/57/10/1012/htm) identified a major outbreak in 1958 amongst nurses at a British hospital as “epidemic hysteria”. This early narrative of ME/CFS as psychogenic has been difficult to shake. It has remained [woefully underfunded](https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203173#ref019): from 2013-2017, NIH funding was only at 7.3% relative commensurate to its disease burden. Note that the [below graph](https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203173#ref019) is on a log scale: ME/CFS is at 7%, Depression and asthma are at 100% and diseases like cancer and HIV are closer to 1000%.

![Graph of NIH funding on log scale, from above paper by Mirin, Dimmock, Leonard](mecfsfunding.jpg){width=50%}

## The myth of rational doctors vs. irrational patients

Above I mentioned the vested financial interests in downplaying the impacts of covid, and parallels to climate change denialism.  Two related issues facing long covid patients are:

- Of the research funding that has been allocated for long covid, [much of it is going to trialling exercise](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00900-w#), which is known to be harmful in the overlapping disease of ME/CFS, and which many patients have already tried on their own and reported as ineffective at best or actively harmful at worst.  [Trialling repurposed drugs](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/991762) that fit with the proposed [underlying physiological mechanisms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2) of long covid would be a far more promising avenue. (Note: exercise is cheap, which may be part of why governments find it appealing)
- Numerous high-profile media outlets have run articles that neglect to mention the research showing the physiological abnormalities of long covid, yet instead perpetuate myths of patients being irrational and suggest that long covid is psychogenic.

Portraying patients as unscientific and irrational is the other side of the same coin for the myth that medicine is perfectly rational. Patients that disagree with having symptoms they know are physiological dismissed as psychogenic, that reject treatments from flawed studies, or who distrust medical institutions based on their experiences of racism, sexism, and mis-diagnosis, are labeled as “militant” or “irrational”, and placed in the same category with conspiracy theorists and those peddling disinformation.

On an individual level, receiving a psychological misdiagnosis lengthens the time it will take to get the right diagnosis, since many doctors will stop looking for physiological explanations. A study of 12,000 rare disease patients [covered by the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180523-how-gender-bias-affects-your-healthcare) found that “while being misdiagnosed with the wrong physical disease doubled the time it took to get to the right diagnosis, getting a psychological misdiagnosis extended it even more – by 2.5 up to 14 times, depending on the disease.”  This dynamic holds true at the disease level as well: once a disease is mis-labeled as psychogenic, many doctors will stop looking for physiological origins.

High profile platforms such as [the WSJ](https://www.codastory.com/waronscience/long-covid/), [New Yorker](https://www.wearebodypolitic.com/bodytype/2021/10/19/new-yorker-long-covid), [New York Magazine](https://virology.ws/2022/11/12/trial-by-error-more-on-that-new-york-magazine-piece-pushing-psychogenic-view-of-me-cfs-and-long-covid/), and [the New Republic](https://publicherald.org/the-new-republic-has-long-covid-all-wrong/) have all sought to suggest that long covid is psychogenic, while failing to cite the abundant research on long covid's physiological basis (given that clicks often lead to revenue, I have linked to critiques of these articles rather than the articles themselves). I will dissect a [New Yorker article](https://www.fast.ai/2021/09/25/new-yorker/) by Dhruv Kullar as one example, but the patterns described here are common tropes.  Khullar neglected to interview any clinicians who treat long covid patients nor to cite the already abundant research at the time on how covid causes damage to many organ systems, yet interviewed doctors in unrelated fields (the primary MD interviewed for the article is best known for his substack encouraging vaccine hesitancy, and for trolling long covid patients on twitter). In response to a patient’s assertion that covid impacts the brain, Khullar spent an entire paragraph detailing how there was no evidence that covid crosses the blood-brain barrier, but didn’t mention the research on covid patients finding [cognitive dysfunction](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51350) and [deficits](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00324-2/fulltext), [PET scans similar to those seen in Alzheimer’s patients](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/26/1019875347/doctors-worry-that-memory-problems-after-covid-19-may-set-stage-for-alzheimers), [neurological damage](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00259-021-05215-4), and [shrinking grey matter](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258690v1). This left a general audience with the mistaken impression that it is unproven whether covid impacts the brain, and is a familiar tactic from bad-faith science debates.

The New Yorker article (like many articles) set up a strict dichotomy between long covid patients and doctors, suggesting that patients harbor a “disregard for expertise”; are less “concerned about what is and isn’t supported by evidence”; and are overly “impatient.” In contrast, doctors appreciate the “careful study design, methodical data analysis, and the skeptical interpretation of results” that medicine requires. Of course, this is a false dichotomy: many patients are more knowledgeable about the latest research than their doctors, some [patients are publishing in peer-reviewed journals](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext), and there are many [medical doctors that are also patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-021-00016-0).  And on the other hand, doctors are just as prone as the rest of us to biases, blind spots, and institutional errors.

Now, it is more important than ever to recognize that medicine, like all science, is political. Medical research is vitally important, but we need to keep in mind the myriad factors that shape it: who provides funding, who receives that funding, which questions get asked, how questions are framed, what data is recorded, what data is left out, what categories included, and whose suffering is counted.


## Cut material

They developed informed, science-based demands.

It is hard to separate the science vs. the policy here, as there were science and policy perspectives on both sides. I think a more fitting framing in this case is activists vs. the establishment. The “establishment” perspective (which included both many scientists and politicians) was that research should continue in the usual ways.  Not much was known about HIV at the time. Funding was quite limited. 
 The view of activists was that young people were dying of AIDS at an alarming rate, and the situation called for greater urgency and new methods for fast-tracking drug trials.  One of their slogans was "drugs into bodies" signifying that it was urgent that patients begin treatment, even if these drugs were still in the early stages of study. They also argued for alternative methods rather than having a placebo group (when it was known that people in the placebo group would die without treatment).
 Another notable protest occurred in 1990, when ACT UP took over parts of the NIH campus.
ACT UP was a collective with thousands of members.  A few particularly notable figures were Larry Kramer, Peter Staley, Mark Harrington, David Barr, Garance Franke-Ruta, Gregg Gonsalves, and Ann Northrup. On the establishment side, the head of the FDA at the time was Dr. Frank Young, who had a PhD in microbiology as well as his MD, and the head of the NIH was Dr. William F. Raub, who had a PhD in physiology and developed a computer system for studying chemical/biological interrelationships. Dr. Anthony Fauci was a young researcher at the NIH, who ended up becoming a useful ally to ACT UP. Ronald Reagan was president, and he was very slow to act, waiting 5 years to even publicly acknowledge AIDS, with 6,000 Americans dying in the meantime.
ACT UP had  The FDA and NIH responded to these protests by making significant changes in process. 
The activists of ACT UP were effective at rapidly accelerating the rate of AIDS research and drug trials, and this work saved countless lives.  Far greater funding and urgency were put into finding treatments. The huge progress that has happened in HIV/AIDS research and treatment would not have happened without their efforts. They also provide a powerful illustration of the potential for patients and community members to serve as scientific experts on the issues that directly impact them.


By 1987, [40,000 Americans had already died of AIDS], yet the government and pharmaceutical companies were doing little to address this health crisis. AIDS was heavily stigmatized, and President Ronald Reagan had delayed for years before even saying the word "AIDS" in public. Federal spending was minimal, and researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators all lacked urgency. The activists of ACT UP used a two pronged approach: creative and confrontational acts of protest, and informed scientific proposals. When the FDA refused to even discuss giving AIDS patients access to experimental drugs, ACT UP protested at their headquarters, blocking entrances and lying down in front of the building with tombstones saying “Killed by the FDA”.  This opened up discussions, and [ACT UP offered viable scientific proposals](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/09/689924838/how-to-demand-a-medical-breakthrough-lessons-from-the-aids-fight), such as switching from the current approach of conducting drug trials on a small group of people over a long time, and instead testing a large group of people over a short time, radically speeding up the pace at which progress occurred.  ACT UP used similar tactics to protest the NIH and pharmaceutical companies, demanding research on how to treat the opportunistic infections that killed AIDS patients, not solely research for a cure. 

In 2021, I concluded an earlier version of this article by writing: <i>Across the world, we are at a pivotal time in determining how societies and governments will deal with the masses of newly disabled people due to long covid. Narratives that take hold early often have disproportionate staying power. Will we inaccurately label long covid as psychogenic, primarily invest in psychiatric research that can’t address the well-documented physiological damage caused by covid, and financially abandon the patients who are now unable to work?  Or will we take the chance to transform medicine to better recognize the lived experiences and knowledge of patients, to center patient partnerships in biomedical research for complex and multi-system diseases, and strengthen inadequate disability support and services to improve life for all people with disabilities? The decisions we collectively make now on these questions will have reverberations for decades to come.</i>


In topics ranging from covid-19 to HIV research to the long history of wrongly assuming women’s illnesses are psychosomatic, we have seen again and again that medicine, like all science, is political. This shows up in myriad ways, such as: who provides funding, who receives that funding, which questions get asked, how questions are framed, what data is recorded, what data is left out, what categories included, and whose suffering is counted.  

ne may hope that in 10 years we will have clearer diagnostic tests for some illnesses which remain contested now, just as the ability to identify multiple sclerosis improved with better imaging. 

In the meantime, we should listen to patients and trust in their ability to explain their own experiences.

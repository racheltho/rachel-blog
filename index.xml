  <title>AI’s Quest to Predict T Cell Binding– The Holy Grail of Immunology</title>
  <dc:creator>Rachel Thomas</dc:creator>
  <link>https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-08-01-ai-t-cells/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>This post is part 3 in a series on using AI to predict T cell binding. Here are <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-09-t-cells/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-24-neural-nets/">part 2</a>.</em></p>
<p>Better understanding what T cells bind to is a crucial question; some researchers even call it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-023-00835-3">“a holy grail of systems immunology”</a>. While AI is already being used towards solutions, there is still much work to be done in this area!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-09-t-cells/">part 1 of this series</a>, we discussed the importance of determining what a T cell, that multi-purpose hero of the adaptive immune system, can bind to. New research papers on this topic are published each month. Almost all of them use neural networks, and in <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-24-neural-nets/">part 2</a>, we discussed different types of neural networks. Now we will see how different types of neural networks are being applied to T cell binding.</p>
<section id="when-t-cell-binding-makes-a-big-difference" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-t-cell-binding-makes-a-big-difference">When T Cell Binding Makes a Big Difference</h2>
<p>T cells play a role in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BYocBxOfsU&amp;list=PLtmWHNX-gukLirebdPH8lla41SS78kjLD&amp;index=1&amp;t=172s">autoimmune diseases like Type 1 diabetes</a> (where T cells mistakenly destroy insulin-producing cells in the pancreas) and psoriasis (where T cells attack our own skin). T cells are also crucial to a healthy response to cancer. In cancer, something has gone amiss: cells undergo uncontrolled growth. T cells should put a stop to this, but in many cases T cells have been misleadingly soothed into exhaustion.</p>
<p>An increasing number of cancer therapies are based on T cells, and predicting which T cells are the most promising cancer-fighting candidates is crucial. When all is in harmony, our T cells should keep cancer from starting in the first place by quickly identifying and killing any cells which have gone rogue. T cells do this by recognizing small pieces of protein, called peptides, held out to them on special molecules called MHC. If those proteins are the sign of a good cell gone bad, the T cell can destroy the miscreant cell.</p>
<p>We can help the immune system by hanging up WANTED posters with the faces of outlaw proteins on them. This can let the immune system know who to look out for.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">WANTED poster for Cancer/testis antigen family 45 member A1</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In practice, this is done by pairing a cancer peptide (called a “neoantigen”) together with a danger signal, and injecting them into a patient in order to sound the alarm and spur T cells into action. We need to identify which rogue cancer proteins are the most promising candidates for such a therapy. Neural networks are being used for this task!</p>
<p>One key question is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29403468/">which peptides are the best</a> candidates to use in these therapies. A key criteria is that T cells need to be able to recognize the peptide, which means that MHC molecules need to be able to bind to it. Everyone has different T cells and MHC molecules, since these are created by the most diverse genes in the human genome! The answer must be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00260-4">personalized</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="applying-neural-networks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="applying-neural-networks">Applying Neural Networks</h2>
<p>This seems like a question where neural networks could be helpful. In <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-24-neural-nets/">part 2</a>, we discussed several different architectures (sequences of math operations) that we could choose between. One consideration is whether the input to a problem is fixed length or variable length. Are we identifying pictures of dogs, or reading Anna Karenina? The problem of T cell binding can be (and is!) framed both ways, depending on the team and the approach they choose to take. In general, sequences of amino acids can have a huge variety of lengths. However, T cell receptors and the peptides held out by MHC have lengths within a narrow range. As a result, we could use neural net architectures that have developed for fixed length problems. Or we could take advantage of the engineering and large training sets that already went into creating neural networks for variable length proteins. Strong research is being published of both types, and I am curious to see if there will be a consensus 5 years from now on the best approach.</p>
</section>
<section id="to-use-alphafold-or-not" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-use-alphafold-or-not">To Use AlphaFold or Not?</h2>
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-09-t-cells/">part 1</a>, the computer program <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB0RxG1NdtA&amp;list=PLtmWHNX-gukLirebdPH8lla41SS78kjLD&amp;index=2">AlphaFold</a> made headlines in 2020 for its incredible accuracy in taking a 1D sequence of amino acids as input and producing a 3D protein structure as output. It won an international competition for this task by a huge margin, smashing all previous records. Since T cell receptors (TCRs), MHC molecules, and peptides are all proteins, it makes sense that we could modify it for the T cell problem.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-08-01-ai-t-cells/insulin-2ways.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Two different ways of representing the protein insulin: a string of letters, or its 3D structure</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>AlphaFold (and similar models, such as RosettaFold and ESMFold) are excellent at what they do, which is to take a sequence of amino acids and predict the 3D structure of a protein. However, it is possible that these models are simultaneously both overkill and underkill for our T cell question. AlphaFold can handle much longer amino acid sequences than are found in the T cell binding problem, yet it doesn’t account for T cells having not just one, but a <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/82813">pair of TWO sequences</a> of amino acids (known as the alpha and beta chains). AlphaFold was trained on a massive data set, yet that dataset did not include much in the way of T cell or MHC specific data. Some researchers have chosen to modify AlphaFold, adding additional layers for prediction, or fine-tuning on a more relevant dataset, whereas other teams have chosen to design neural networks that are more directly suited to the task at hand.</p>
<p>Which approach is better? It’s tough to tell. Reading papers within the field can be confusing, as many boast of great results. Since there is an absence of consistent benchmarks and models are often not evaluated for accuracy on new peptides, it can be tough to compare different models.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-need-for-a-grand-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-need-for-a-grand-challenge">The Need for a Grand Challenge</h2>
<p>You may wonder why we can’t clearly see which neural network for T cell binding is definitively the best. The ImageNet competition produced a clear winner for recognizing objects in images in 2012: AlexNet, a neural net that was head and shoulders better than the other entries. Similarly, AlphaFold dominated the CASP competition in 2020. However, several factors are necessary to create competitions such as ImageNet or CASP, and these factors do not yet exist for the T cell problem.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">AlphaFold won the 2023 Lasker Award, “America’s Nobel Prize”. The trophies are based on The Winged Victory of Samothrace statue.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>You need a large, well-curated, and representative dataset. This can fail in numerous ways. While data is central to any machine learning project, all too often, data work has been undervalued and neglected. The paper <a href="https://research.google/pubs/everyone-wants-to-do-the-model-work-not-the-data-work-data-cascades-in-high-stakes-ai/">“Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work”</a> drew on interviews with 53 machine learning practitioners across multiple countries. Building fancy math models is rewarded with career advancement, not the arduous labor of collecting and curating the underlying datasets that make those models possible. In many cases, those tasked with collecting data had it piled on top of already demanding jobs, with inadequate communication, training, or compensation. This led to erroneous measurements, miscommunications, and failed projects. To give one example, when machines in a robotic medical AI project were recalibrated, the change was not documented, leading to inconsistent data that was impossible to interpret.</p>
<p>Data work is particularly challenging in the area of T cell receptors (TCRs). Current datasets cover just a <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/82813">tiny fraction</a> of all possible TCRs. It is difficult to scale experimental methods, so less than 1 million unique TCR-peptide pairs have been found experimentally. Of the data that exists, the vast majority just contains one of the two amino acid sequences which make up a TCR, even though both sequences are significant.</p>
<p>You also need everyone to agree on what numerical metrics to use in evaluating success, and for those metrics to closely correspond to the value you care about. Great harm can result <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2019-09-24-metrics/">when those metrics are a poor proxy</a> for the underlying goal. Providing a meaningful numeric score and declaring a winner require the right setup and a lot of effort behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Some researchers have called for a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-023-00835-3">“grand challenge”</a> of inferring T cell receptor binding, similar to the grand challenge in prediction protein folding which led to AlphaFold. Standardizing datasets and setting clear metrics for comparisons could motivate innovation. This is a high-impact area within immunology and medicine and I hope that it is a continued focus of research!</p>

  <title>The Most Common and Useful Neural Nets</title>

<p><em>This post can stand alone as a friendly introduction to neural nets, no background required. It is part 2 in my series on using AI to figure out what T cells can bind to. Here are <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-09-t-cells/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-08-01-ai-t-cells/">part 3</a>.</em></p>
<section id="what-are-neural-networks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-neural-networks">What are Neural Networks?</h2>
<p>Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are currently in the limelight, powering chatbots like ChatGPT and image generators like Midjourney. Neural networks are just math equations, written in computer code. When people hear the terms “neural networks” or “artificial intelligence,” they may picture humanoid robots, but it is more accurate to imagine a scaled-up version of 10th grade math class.</p>
<p>When considering an AI system, two major categories of tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classifying things</strong>: These are not predictions in the sense of predicting the future, but rather, guessing the answer to a question. Is this a picture of a chihuahua or a blueberry muffin? Which of these potential drugs would be most likely to target antibiotic resistant bacteria?</li>
<li><strong>Generating things</strong>: Create a picture of <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/non-artistic-style-transfer-or-how-to-draw-kanye-using-captain-picards-face-c4a50256b814">Kanye West made out of tiny Captain Picard faces</a>. Generate a new molecule that may work as an antibiotic.</li>
</ul>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-24-neural-nets/chihuahua-kanye.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:65.0%"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Classification: muffin or chihuahua? (pic from Karen Zack, <span class="citation" data-cites="teenybiscuit">@teenybiscuit</span>, 2016) // Generation: Kanye out of Picard faces (pic from fast.ai intern Brad Kenstler, 2017)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Some problems in medicine and immunology can be framed either as a classification problem OR as a generative problem. For instance, suppose your goal is to produce a <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-04-03-ai-antibiotics/">new antibiotic to address antimicrobial resistance</a>. Some scientists are trying to classify which compounds, out of hundreds of millions of existing ones, may have the desired properties, whereas others are trying to generate new compounds. Both approaches are useful.</p>
</section>
<section id="language-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="language-models">Language Models</h2>
<p>You may have heard the term “language model” describing chatbots (such as Chat-GPT or Claude) and automated language translation (such as Google Translate and Skype Translator). One approach to developing sophisticated language capabilities is to write a computer program that predicts the next word in a sentence. Predict the next word and then the next, and you can generate strings of text. This is a language model. Both prediction and generation are used to build language models.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-24-neural-nets/google-translate.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:65.0%"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Google Translate relies on language models. The gender bias shown here has since been corrected, although bias remains an issue.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Along the way, the model has learned a number of patterns regarding context, vocabulary, and relationships. Fine tuning lets us use these capabilities for specific problems. For instance, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10338337/">language model trained on medical chart notes</a> was used to make predictions about which patients were most likely to be readmitted to the hospital. While the model was trained on a prediction task (predicting the next word in a sentence), it can now be used for generation as well when combined with some additional techniques when it is given additional instructions and training from humans.</p>
<p>When language models are trained, they are not always just tasked with predicting the next word. In a sentence, sometimes random words are covered up, and the computer must predict what goes in that spot. It is a fill-in-the-blank assignment.</p>
<p>Through predicting words, the model can learn which other words to focus on. Suppose I told you, “I am so tired that I can barely keep my XXXX open”. You could likely guess that the missing word is “eyes”. To do so, you may have focused on “tired” and “open”. Some of the word positions add little, if anything, to your efforts of deduction. In a similar way, attention-based neural networks learn what to pay attention to, where to focus.</p>
<p>Like the sequence of words in a novel, a sequence of amino acids is its own language, telling the story of a protein. The same techniques and approaches that were developed for natural languages (such as translating between English and French) can also be applied to the biological language of protein creation.</p>
</section>
<section id="popular-architectures" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="popular-architectures">Popular architectures</h2>
<p>Neural networks are often created from a few popular architectures, which are particular combinations of mathematical operations. Something that can be confusing is that different architectures can often be combined with one another. Also, most of these architectures can be used for both predictive and generative problems. Here are a few particularly popular ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)</strong>: the oldest example of a neural network was developed in the 1960s! It is the basis of many systems used today (<a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015039846566?urlappend=%3Bseq=13">Rosenblatt 1962</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong>: are like a filter that you scan across a picture, inch by inch, to recognize what is in it. This is useful for programs such as those bird-watcher apps that will tell you what type of bird you spotted, based on the photo you upload (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/726791">Lecun et al.&nbsp;1998</a>; <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/hash/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Abstract.html">Krizhevsky et al.&nbsp;2012</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong>: can take variable-length input (that is, sequences) and store state. Google began using these for translating between languages in 2016 (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6795963">Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144">Wu et al.&nbsp;2016</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Transformers</strong>: offer a more efficient approach for sequences, which can be any length. These are based on <strong>attention</strong>, as explained above. These have now replaced RNNs in many applications, including Google Translate, which lets a user enter a word or phrase, or even entire paragraphs, and get back the response in another language (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Vaswani et al.&nbsp;2017</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Graph Neural Network (GNNs)</strong>: Allow for geometric relationships in the input to be captured. For example, GNNs can help represent the spatial relationships between different amino acids in a sequence. Principles of GNNs are typically combined with other options in the list above (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4700287">Scarselli et al.&nbsp;2009</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19193509/">Micheli 2009</a>).</li>
</ul>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-24-neural-nets/convolution2.gif" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:65.0%"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">How a convolution works, from deeplearning.net, 2018</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>How do you choose a neural network for your problem? One key consideration is how much the size of your input varies. Suppose you have a collection of photos and are trying to determine which are of cats and which are of dogs. Your photos are likely of similar sizes, and you can make them the same by adding a frame around the smaller ones. Whole families of neural networks have been developed for such problems with fixed-size input.</p>
<p>Now suppose you are developing a neural network that can read books and predict which word will come next. The difference in length between The Hungry Hungry Caterpillar and Les Miserables is huge. For this problem, we need a network that allows variable-size input. RNNs and Transformers allow variable-length input, whereas CNNs take fixed-size input.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-innovation-of-alphafold" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-innovation-of-alphafold">The Innovation of AlphaFold</h2>
<p>Recall from <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-09-t-cells/">Part 1 of this series</a> that the computer program AlphaFold revolutionized the task of taking a 1D sequence of amino acids (shown on the left), and transforming it into a 3D molecule (shown on the right).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-24-neural-nets/insulin-2ways.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Two different ways of representing the protein insulin: a string of letters, or its 3D structure</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The text of a book is 1-dimensional. It could be written on a single long ribbon, stretched out, and read as such. However, best making sense of amino acid sequences requires an additional dimension. We want to know not just the long ribbon of a single sequence, but the evolutionary relationships of related sequences it is similar to.</p>
<p>A crucial innovation of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">AlphaFold</a> is that it expanded attention to 2 dimensions. The 2 dimensions are the sequence of the amino acids, as well as a block of sequences of similar sequences. These similar sequences provide important evolutionary clues of what our protein of interest may be like. Like distant cousins in a family tree, they can give us insights of what may be some common features. This set of related sequences is known as a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and is a key component in bioinformatics. AlphaFold applies attention to the MSA, learning which parts of related sequences to focus on in trying to decode a protein structure.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">AlphaFold represents sequences 2 ways. The MSA representation requires 2D attention. Image from Jumper, et al, 2021</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Returning to our list of popular architectures, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB0RxG1NdtA&amp;t=2s">AlphaFold</a> combines aspects of Transformers (in a new form, named the Evoformer, which has 2D attention) and Graph Neural Networks (to represent the spatial relationships between amino acids). Now that we have covered some of the types of neural networks and the structure of AlphaFold, we are ready to combine this with the information about T cells from <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-09-t-cells/">part 1</a>. <strong>Check out <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-08-01-ai-t-cells/">part 3</a> to see how AI is being used to predict T cell binding.</strong></p>

<p><em>I’m studying the intersection of AI and immunology, two notoriously jargon-heavy fields – but it’s important that scientists share their work with a broader audience. This 3-part series is an experiment: an accessible introduction to AI immunology concepts. This post is part 1 in a series on using AI to predict T cell binding. Here are <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-07-24-neural-nets/">part 2</a> and <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-08-01-ai-t-cells/">part 3</a>.</em></p>
<p>T cells are one of the most important cell types of our immune systems, assassinating cells that have been infected by viruses or turned cancerous, and sending commands to other immune cells to organize responses against invaders. T cells can help mobilize against a wide range of threats due to their incredible diversity. They are able to rearrange their genes to recognize billions of different types of infected or rogue cells.</p>
<p>Figuring out how to predict what a T cell will bind to (meaning what cells it can recognize as bad and coordinate attacks against) would be a vital medical breakthrough. Some cancer therapies are based on teaching T cells to better recognize tumor cells. Knowing the answer could help us design new drugs. And not knowing can have disastrous consequences. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3743463/">therapy was trialed</a> in which patients were injected with T cells that would kill cells displaying a protein that is commonly found in cancer, but is not displayed by healthy cells. Tragically, it turns out that these T cells can also bind to a different and unrelated protein found in heart muscles, and two patients died of cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>In this 3-part series, I will explore efforts to use AI to predict what T cells will bind to, and why it matters.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="t-cells-our-multi-purpose-immune-heroes">T cells, our multi-purpose immune heroes</h2>
<p>At their best, T cells destroy viral-infected cells and stop cancer before we ever develop symptoms. When things go awry, T cells can accidentally attack our own cells – for instance Type 1 Diabetes occurs when T cells mistakenly destroy insulin-producing cells in the pancreas and psoriasis is caused by T cells attacking the skin (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BYocBxOfsU">check out this 5 minute video I made for more information about confused T cells</a>). Or “exhausted” T cells can sit idly by as tumors rapidly grow.</p>
<p>T cell receptors (TCRs) are protein complexes on the outside of a T cell. The way a T cell recognizes a problematic cell is by binding to a small piece of protein, called a peptide. T cells can bind only to peptides that are presented to them on fancy platters– err, I mean on special molecules called MHC molecules, found on the outside of cells. The binding of TCR-peptide-MHC is like a secret handshake. The TCR is very specific about which peptides it can bind to. Most combinations will not work.</p>

</div>
<p>Since TCRs are made of protein, and they bind to small pieces of protein, it is helpful to consider some related questions about proteins before we tackle TCR binding in more detail.</p>

<section id="proteins-workhorses-of-the-cell" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proteins-workhorses-of-the-cell">Proteins: workhorses of the cell</h2>
<p>Proteins make life as we know it possible; they are <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128251-300-first-life-the-search-for-the-first-replicator/">responsible for the hard work</a> that goes on within our cells. <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/protein-function-14123348/">Proteins give our cells</a> shape and structure, and help them stay organized. Most biochemical reactions occur thanks to enzymes, which are entirely made of proteins. And hormones are proteins that send messages around the body.</p>
<p>The 3D shape of a protein is crucial to understanding how it functions within the body and what roles it plays. However, the information we often receive about proteins is not 3D. It is a list of letters – a sequence of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. These lists can twist and fold, creating spirals, sheets, and other interesting sculptures.</p>
<p>For example, insulin is an important protein messenger that lets our cells know when they should absorb more sugar. Insulin consists of this sequence of 110 amino acids (there are 20 distinct amino acids, and each has a letter representing it):</p>
<p><code>MALWMRLLPLLALLALWGPDPAAAFVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKTRREAEDLQVGQVELGGGPGAGSLQPLALEGSLQKRGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN</code></p>
<p>However, to really understand insulin, we need to know what it <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P01308">looks like as a 3D molecule</a>. Its shape and structure helps determine which other molecules will interact with it.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>The insulin receptor (which is on the surface of cells and can bind to insulin, receiving the message and sending off an internal signal within the cell) is also a protein. It is a sequence of over 1,000 amino acids and has a <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P06213">far more complicated structure</a>.</p>

<p>In 1994, a competition was established for researchers to go head-to-head in trying to best answer this question. Leading up to the competition, as scientists discovered new protein structures, using laboratory techniques such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, they kept some of the results secret. Later, these structures would be freely shared with other scientists, but for now, they must be held apart for the challenge. The somewhat dry name, <a href="https://predictioncenter.org/">Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP)</a>, belies the importance of this task.</p>
<p>In the competition, each team submits their guesses, generated by computer programs they created. The distance between the guesses and the actual structures is measured in Angstroms, with 1 Angstrom being one just ten-billionth of a meter.</p>
<p>CASP did not make international headlines until 2020. This is when an entry, titled <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">AlphaFold</a> smashed all existing records, and all competitors, by a wide margin. AlphaFold was created by DeepMind, an AI company owned by Google.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-with-t-cell-data">Challenges with T cell data</h2>
<p>At first glance, it may seem like AlphaFold would give us a solution to our T cell problem. After all, T cell receptors are made of proteins, and they bind to other proteins. Aren’t protein structures a solved problem? Not so fast. The T cell receptor problem poses many different and additional challenges.</p>
<p>There are a few factors that make the question of what a T cell will bind to– known as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-023-00835-3">T cell receptor specificity</a>– distinctive and more complicated than the problem AlphaFold solves. First of all, AlphaFold was created to predict protein structures from a single chain of amino acids. However, TCRs have 2 key chains of amino acids: alpha and beta. Both are important. These alpha and beta chains can be <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/82813">mixed and matched</a> willy-nilly.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>Another issue is that we have far less data on TCRs than we do on general proteins. The genes that code for the TCR vary greatly across the population. They are some of the most diverse genes in the entire human genome! This means that the (relatively small) dataset we do have is only a fraction of what exists. AlphaFold is based on machine learning, and machine learning models are highly dependent on the quality, quantity, and nature of the data used to train them.</p>

<p>This is part 2 in a series covering surprising facts about the microbiome. Be sure to check out <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-04-25-microbiome-1/">part 1 here</a>. A microbiome is the community of microorganisms found living together in a given habitat. The microbiome of the human gut can contribute to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BYocBxOfsU&amp;list=PLtmWHNX-gukLirebdPH8lla41SS78kjLD">development of autoimmune disease</a>. The microbiome of plant roots can include bacteria traveling on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpgAA1mh7Io">fungal super-highways</a>. Scientists also study the microbiome of nanoplastics floating in the ocean and the tiny microbes throughout our atmosphere that catalyze precipitation. Microbiomes influence food chains, weather patterns, and the human immune system.</p>
<section id="microbes-are-everywhere" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="microbes-are-everywhere">Microbes are everywhere</h2>
<p>When I lived in California there were several years in which we had widespread wildfire smoke that was harmful to breathe, polluted the air, and created an eerie yellow hue. I knew that smoke contains toxins, and I incorrectly assumed that it wouldn’t be a suitable habitat for anything living. Counter-intuitively, <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe8116">smoke is a good habitat for some microbes</a>, as the particulate matter helps block UV rays that might otherwise kill them. Water vapor produced by the combustion of biomass can help prevent microbes from drying out. And convective columns and updraft winds can draw in microbes from long distances.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(23)00046-3/fulltext">One study on the California wildfires</a> found that hospitalizations for coccidioidomycosis, a dangerous fungal infection, increased by 20% in the month following smoke exposure. This is a worrying threat given that the climate crisis has led to increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires. There is even a nascent field of <strong>pyroaerobiology</strong>, studying the aerosolization and transport of <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2507">microbes by wildfires</a>.</p>
<p>An estimated 5-13 million tons of plastic enter the oceans each year, including run-off from polluted rivers. Floating “islands” of plastic debris, including microplastics less than 5 mm in size, are found in the oceans. These plastics impact <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.01112-20">over 700 different species of aquatic life</a>, ranging from microscopic phytoplankton to large whales. There are microbes that thrive on microplastics, <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/150017">forming the Plastisphere</a>. Unfortunately, this thin film of bacteria and fungi living on microplastics may make them more appealing to some sea animals, such as loggerhead turtles, to eat. Researchers have found that the Atlantic and Pacific oceans have distinct Plastisphere communities, and that these differences may necessitate different remediation approaches.</p>

<p>Researchers are also investigating how microbes can be used to break down these dangerous plastics. One interesting research study collated data on <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.01112-20">over 16,000 genes involved in plastic degradation</a>. These genes came from 6,000 microbial species, showing that there are numerous possibilities of potential microbes that may be used for bioremediation. Researchers have even found some microbes can be used <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01697-4">to help break down PFAS</a>, often called “forever chemicals”, which are polluting aquatic environments. While it is very difficult to break down the fluorine-carbon bonds found in PFAS, microbes can instead first break chlorine-carbon bonds in the chemicals, which then makes it easier to remove the fluorine atoms.</p>

<p><em>Pseudomonas syringae</em> is a plant pathogen that is a scourge of agricultural crops. It infects almost all economically valuable species of crops and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5972017/">threatens global agriculture production</a>.</p>
<p>But actually it’s not all bad – this same species of bacteria is important to weather precipitation cycles. For temperatures above -40 degrees C, ice formation requires a catalyst, called an ice nucleator. Researchers have discovered that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0809816105">most ice nucleators are biological</a>: tiny microbes that are widely dispersed throughout the atmosphere all over the world, even in Antarctica! And it turns out that <a href="https://www.activeremedy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/brent-christner_2012_cloudy-with-a-chance-of-microbes.pdf"><em>Pseudomonas syringae</em> is a common nucleator for catalyzing precipitation</a>. This example highlights the complexity of microbial ecosystems. Efforts to protect plants from this pathogen must take into account the interrelated impact on precipitation.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Another example of a microbe that can’t be clearly classified as “good” or “bad” is <em>Prevotella Copri</em>, found in the human gut microbiome. An aptly titled paper, “The curious case of Prevotella copri” describes “puzzling discrepancies” in how various research studies have associated this species with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10478744/">range of positive and negative impacts on disease</a>.</p>
<p>The authors share that high abundance of P. copri is associated with non-Western diets, rheumatoid arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis (a type of inflammatory arthritis), Graves’ orbitopathy (autoimmune condition that can damage vision vision), diabetes mellitus, and cancer. This is particularly surprising, because several of the inflammatory and autoimmune conditions listed are more strongly associated with Western diets. Low abundance of P. copri is associated with Western diets, glucose intolerance, chronic hives, Parkinson’s disease, and food allergies.</p>

</div>
<p>It is unclear whether abundant <em>Prevotella copri</em> in the gut is good or bad. The paper notes that <em>P. copri</em> has a diverse set of strains, which differ from the reference strain, and may partly explain the discrepancies. The ways that gut microbes interact with each other, our immune systems, and our genetics can be quite complex, and these factors may mediate how P. copri influences a person’s health.</p>

<p>We often talk about microbiomes at an individual level: the microbes inside the guts of a person (or insect) or the microbes on their skin or in their mouth. However, researchers also study the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1220-8"><strong>social microbiome</strong></a>: the metacommunity of all the microbiomes of animals in a social community. Members of a community can influence each other’s microbiomes through their social bonds.</p>

<p>One study sampled the <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/53/">skin microbiome of roller derby players</a> before and after games. The three teams in the study each came from a different city and state. They found that prior to a game, the microbiomes were more similar within a team, and different across teams. However, after competing in a game, which involves a fair amount of physical contact, all of the players’ skin microbiomes were more similar to one another.</p>

<p>Much of the research on the social microbiome has been done on nonhuman primates, where grooming, mating, feeding, and other close contact have been shown to impact the microbiome. Social networks and group membership were found to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379495/">determine the microbiomes of baboons</a>, and were more predictive than age or gender.</p>
<p>For some animals, microbiomes inside of scent glands are used to communicate group membership. Hyenas typically live in social clans of 40-80 individuals, and these clans are often overlapping in their territories. They secrete fermentative bacteria from their scent glands. This allows for group-specific odors, making it easier for the hyenas to communicate if they are in the same group as one another. <a href="">One study found</a> that the relative abundance of different types of bacteria was distinctive for different hyena clans.</p>

<p>Understanding the microbiome is a crucial piece of better understanding the health of plants, humans, and other animals, as well as our environment. Microbes synthesize vitamins, catalyze precipitation, spread disease or protect from it, can remediate or exacerbate the impacts of pollution, and influence food chains. Only with relatively recent advances in genomic sequencing have we been able to better study and compare the balance of species composing different microbiomes. This is a fascinating and growing area of research.</p>

<p><em>This is part 1 in a series. You can <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-05-07-microbiome-2/">read part 2 here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Humans <a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00875-0">co-evolved together</a> with our microbiomes, the bacteria and fungi that colonize our intestines, coat our skin, and inhabit our mouths, throats, and numerous other body locations. Microbiomes are significant because they influence how we process nutrients, fight pathogens, and what diseases we are susceptible to. This is not just true of humans, but plants and insects also have microbiomes that influence their metabolism and immune systems.</p>
<p>A microbiome is the community of microorganisms found living together in a given habitat– this does not just include living on a host. Scientists study the microbiomes of nanoplastics floating in the ocean, covered in bacteria and fungi, and of the tiny microbes throughout the atmosphere that catalyze precipitation. Even wildfire smoke has a microbiome. These environmental microbiomes influence food chains, weather patterns, and the spread of disease. We can’t fully understand the impacts of pollution and climate change without studying them.</p>
<p>Studying the microbiome is crucial for better understanding the health and disease of humans, other animals, plants, and our environment. In this 2-part series, I will cover a grab bag of surprising and fascinating facts about the microbiome.</p>
<section id="when-the-immune-system-attacks-friendly-bacteria" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-the-immune-system-attacks-friendly-bacteria">When the immune system attacks friendly bacteria…</h2>
<p>Commensal bacteria, often referred to as “friendly”, are bacteria that live on human skin or in the gut and help us. The human gut microbiome can help synthesize vitamins we need, regulate dopamine, and protect us from infection. However, so-called friendly bacteria can cause grave problems when they cross out of the gut into the bloodstream. Microbes can’t necessarily be classified as “good” or “bad”, and this impact of what happens when microbes cross from the gut to the blood is an example of this.</p>
<p>I created a short 5 minute video to explain these ideas, geared for a general audience:</p>
<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BYocBxOfsU?si=aSkr2Zmp5HRGwg0Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>If “friendly” microbes stray into the bloodstream, our immune system may mount an attack against them by producing antibodies and activating T cells (the two primary approaches of our adaptive immune systems). The small regions on a bacteria recognized by T cells or antibodies are known as <strong>epitopes</strong>. All bacteria have many epitopes, and genetics helps determine which particular epitopes your immune system is able to recognize. Two different people will likely produce T cells recognizing different epitopes for the same bacteria.</p>

<p>If the epitopes our immune system attacks are too similar to regions on our own cells, autoimmune disease can develop. This means that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9737253/">friendly bacteria that has leaked into the bloodstream</a> (where it does not belong) “looks” too similar to some of your own cells. For instance, if the bacteria “looks” like your pancreatic cells (which produce insulin), your T cells may begin mistakenly attacking these insulin-producing cells, leading to Type 1 Diabetes.</p>
<p>The microbiome can also play a role in how likely microbes are to leak out of a person’s gut in the first place! Low levels of certain commensal bacteria increases gut permeability. This heightened permeability allowing the microbes to leave the intestines. This process has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9737253/">linked to progression of Type 1 Diabetes</a> to more advanced stages. Note that commensal bacteria are just one potential trigger for the development of autoimmune diseases. As I discussed in a <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2023-03-22-viruses2/">previous post</a>, viral infections can also trigger Type 1 Diabetes and other autoimmune diseases.</p>

<p>Plants also have microbiomes. One component of the plant microbiome are fungi that surround the plant roots and the bacteria that travel along these “fungal highways.” The fungi exude sugars that the bacteria use as an energy source along their journeys. The bacteria are able to mineralize organic phosphate, which is beneficial to the fungus and to the plant. Together, the fungus, plant, and bacteria are in symbiotic relationships.</p>

<p>For more on fungal highways, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpgAA1mh7Io">here is a 3 minute Science Fridays video</a> which discusess how fungal networks optimize traffic to avoid traffic jams. It’s created by Christian Baker, who does a great job of explaining science in a succinct and engaging way. In this video, he interviews math professor Dr.&nbsp;Marcus Roper of UCLA who studies the fluid dynamics of bacterial travel.</p>
<p>Other researchers are looking at the use of fungal highways to allow <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16047804/">pollutant-degrading bacteria to travel</a>, which could help remove pollutants in a broader area as part of bioremediation efforts.</p>
<p>Plant microbiomes have a strong influence on their immune function. They help prevent the colonization and growth of pathogens. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-023-00900-7">climate change is altering the microbiomes of plants</a>, which can make them more susceptible to disease. There are several mechanisms by which this can happen. Climate change alters the composition of microbes found in soil, which is the first line of defense for plants against pathogens. Plants release chemicals and metabolites into the soil, which are useful for attracting beneficial microbiomes, and climate change can harm plants’ capacity to do this (at least in the same quantities as before). Both plants and microbes may migrate into new areas due to changes in climate, further disrupting previous equilibriums.</p>

<p>My microbiome course began with an in-depth unit covering different methods for sequencing genomes. There have been <a href="">multiple revolutions</a> in gene sequencing technology in recent decades, and new machines for gene sequencing are released regularly. Our growing understanding of the microbiome would not be possible without this technology to sequence numerous bacterial species in a sample, and in many ways the field is very young, with lots of open questions remaining.</p>
<p>Even though microbiome research has only taken off in the last 20 years with the advent of new sequencing technologies, ideas about the microbiome and its role in health have been around for a long time. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3426293/">Antonie van Leewenhoek used a microscope</a> to compare the microbes in his oral and fecal microbiota in the 1680s.</p>

<p>Élie Metchnikoff, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine 1908, is best known as the father of cellular immunity. He discovered that there are immune cells that can ingest pathogens. He named them “eating cells” (phagocytes), and we now refer to these immune cells as “big eaters” (macrophages). In addition to discovering cellular immunity, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2013.00052/full">Metchnikoff is considered</a> one of the founders of probiotics. He believed consuming sour milk (yogurt) would be beneficial for the microbiome and he laid the conceptual framework for fecal transplantation to modify the microbiome, over 100 years ago. Questions about whether and how we can alter our microbiomes are still being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5374383/">studied and debated</a> today, as are the roles of genetics, lifestyle, and environment in influencing the microbiome.</p>

  <title>Using AI to Discover New Antibiotics</title>

<section id="a-growing-threat" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-growing-threat">A Growing Threat</h2>
<p>The WHO estimates that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) contributed to approximately 5 million deaths worldwide in 2019 (<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance">“Antimicrobial Resistance” 2023</a>). In the USA, AMR results annually in 8 million additional days spent in the hospital and over $20 billion in healthcare costs (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4206945/">Bush et al.&nbsp;2011</a>). The problem will only grow in magnitude as antibiotic resistant genes in bacteria spread. AMR is compounded by the fact that development of new antibiotics has stalled over the past few decades. Historically, antibiotics were primarily discovered from natural products generated by soil microbes. This approach led to an initial burst of discoveries in the mid-20th century, but since then, soil screening has produced diminishing returns. Other antibiotics were created as derivatives of known antibiotics, but these have a limited ability to outpace antibiotic resistance (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8463434/">Randall and Davies 2021</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>Developing new drugs is an expensive, time-consuming, and failure-prone process, with only a small percentage of potential drug candidates making it from discovery through clinical testing to regulatory approval. Antibiotic research has been particularly neglected due to unfavourable financial incentives. New antibiotics are typically only used if standard antibiotics fail, and antibiotics are given for a limited course. Thus, antibiotic research is not seen as profitable and pharmaceutical companies have largely avoided it (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4273861/">Durrant and Amaro 2015</a>). Artificial intelligence holds promise for accelerating research to address this threat, although there are also limitations and risks.</p>
</section>
<section id="possibilities-with-deep-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="possibilities-with-deep-learning">Possibilities with Deep Learning</h2>
<p>Machine learning uses data to find patterns, as opposed to relying on manually coded rules. Deep learning is a powerful family of machine learning algorithms, responsible for the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. The field of has seen massive improvements in accuracy and speed, and reductions in cost. Key reasons for this progress are the affordability of GPUs (processors used in video gaming which can quickly perform numerical computations in parallel), increases in available data, and research advances in the underlying algorithms (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539">LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015</a>).</p>
<p>Deep learning-assisted approaches to drug discovery offer a potentially faster and cheaper way to identify new antibiotic candidates. It is estimated that there are 10<sup>30</sup>–10<sup>60</sup> potential drug-like chemicals; this scale means it is impossible to explore even a fraction of these (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8429579/">Melo, Maasch, and de la Fuente-Nunez 2021</a>). Algorithms can help determine what compounds to prioritize.</p>

<section id="protein-folding-approaches-with-ai" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="protein-folding-approaches-with-ai">Protein Folding Approaches with AI</h2>
<p>AlphaFold has revolutionized protein structure prediction (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">Jumper et al.&nbsp;2021</a>, my <a href="https://youtu.be/pB0RxG1NdtA">summary here</a>) and there has been interest in using it to aid in antibiotic discovery. Researchers applied AlphaFold to the essential proteins from <em>E. coli</em> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9446081/">Wong et al.&nbsp;2022</a>). They then used molecular docking programs to predict if these sites would be able to bind with over 300 different existing drug compounds. When they tested the predictions experimentally in the lab, they found that accuracy was relatively low. One limitation of the approach is that AlphaFold does not differentiate between active vs.&nbsp;inactive conformations. The researchers highlighted the need for better scoring functions to accurately rank the binding poses and for benchmarking datasets to evaluate performance (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9446081/">Wong et al.&nbsp;2022</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>A more recent pre-print (not yet peer-reviewed) offered a potential explanation of AlphaFold’s poor performance on predicting existing drugs (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.20.572662v1">Lyu et al.&nbsp;2023</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00130-8">news coverage</a>). The authors proposed that minor differences in structure may cause AlphaFold to miss existing drugs, but that it may be identifying equally promising ones. Starting with 2 known protein structures, the researchers used AlphaFold to virtually screen millions of potential drugs and then synthesized a few hundred of the most promising candidates. For comparison, they also followed a more traditional process to screen and synthesize drug candidates. Even though AlphaFold and the traditional process yielded completely different drug candidates, they had similar success rates of how many of the candidates bound to the proteins of interest as predicted (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.20.572662v1">Lyu et al.&nbsp;2023</a>).</p>

<section id="predicting-antibacterial-activity-with-ai" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="predicting-antibacterial-activity-with-ai">Predicting Antibacterial Activity with AI</h2>
<p>Other work has not relied on protein structure prediction software like AlphaFold, but instead created deep learning models directly for the underlying problem. Researchers used training sets of thousands of small molecule drugs to build models predicting which will have antibacterial activity (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349178/">Stokes et al.&nbsp;2020</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01349-8">Liu et al.&nbsp;2023</a>). Message-passing neural networks, a type of deep learning model, allow for iteratively exchanging information between adjacent atoms and bonds. This captures some of the structural information of a protein, without explicitly predicting protein structure. A model was created using a dataset of thousands of repurposed drugs, and then applied to chemical libraries containing over 100 million molecules (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349178/">Stokes et al.&nbsp;2020</a>). The output was a ranking of the most promising drug candidates based on predicted antibacterial activity, chemical structure, and availability. This approach predicted that Halicin, which is structurally distinct form existing classes of antibiotics, would be an effective drug. When tested empirically, Halicin demonstrated a broad-spectrum impact against bacteria including M. tuberculosis, carbapenem-resistant <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>, <em>C. difficile</em>, and multi-resistant <em>A. baumannii</em> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349178/">Stokes et al.&nbsp;2020</a>).</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">The process used to discover Aubacin with a message-passing neural network (Figure 1 from Stokes, et al, 2020)</figcaption>

<p>A similar approach was used by the same lab to train a deep learning model to predict antibiotics that would be effective against multi-resistant <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01349-8">Liu et al.&nbsp;2023</a>). The WHO has designated drug resistant <em>A. baumannii</em> as one of the highest priorities for urgent development of new antibiotics. The model discovered a new antibiotic drug, Aubacin, which is structurally distinct from existing classes of antibiotics. In a lab experiment, Aubacin was effective at supressing <em>A. baumannii</em> in a mouse wound. It was also effective when tested against 41 different strains of resistant A. baumannii from the CDC Antibiotic Resistant Isolation bank (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01349-8">Liu et al.&nbsp;2023</a>).</p>

<section id="data-sources-and-tools" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-sources-and-tools">Data Sources and Tools</h2>
<p>AI models are highly dependent on the data used to train them. Training data shapes the accuracy of a model, helps set what possibilities are considered, and determines the context in which it is appropriate to use. One useful data source is the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/drug-repurposing-hub">Drug Repurposing Hub</a> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4306">Corsello et al.&nbsp;2017</a>), which contains a hand-curated collection of thousands of existing drugs, including ones where safety was established in clinical trials, but that never obtained regulatory approval. Applying existing drugs to new diseases other than that which they were originally developed for is a pragmatic approach that can have a rapid and lower-cost impact. Another useful tool is the <a href="https://zinc15.docking.org/">ZINC15 database</a>, which includes data on small molecules, including their biological activity and chemical properties (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00559">Sterling and Irwin 2015</a>). Both the Drug Repurposing Hub and ZINC 15 databases have been used in neural network approaches (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349178/">Stokes et al.&nbsp;2020</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01349-8">Liu et al.&nbsp;2023</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rdkit.org/">RDKit</a> is an open-source library that can be used to compute molecular features. Some researchers use these computed features to augment the data gathered purely from existing structures and ligands, using one of the above databases together with RDKit-computed features as inputs to their models (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01349-8">Liu et al.&nbsp;2023</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="risks-and-limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="risks-and-limitations">Risks and Limitations</h2>
<p>The research described above of antibiotics discovered through deep learning-assisted processes is still in preliminary stages, with none of those drugs having yet begun clinical trials, much less reached regulatory approval. In other fields, machine learning models have sometimes performed well in testing but failed to work as expected when deployed in the real world (<a href="https://research.google/pubs/everyone-wants-to-do-the-model-work-not-the-data-work-data-cascades-in-high-stakes-ai/">Sambasivan et al.&nbsp;2021</a>). Issues can arise when the context and quality of the training data is not fully understood (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458723">Gebru et al.&nbsp;2021</a>). ML systems are trained in clearly defined environments, while the physical world often has complex and volatile underlying phenomena, which are not fully accounted for during training. This can create a brittleness in ML-generated solutions. Moreover, there is a conflicting incentive system in which the creators of ML models are rewarded with prestige, but the arduous work used to gather and curate the data used to train those models is often neglected and taken for granted (<a href="https://research.google/pubs/everyone-wants-to-do-the-model-work-not-the-data-work-data-cascades-in-high-stakes-ai/">Sambasivan et al.&nbsp;2021</a>).</p>
<p>However, given the urgency of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, it is important that we consider a variety of innovative solutions for tackling it. Deep learning can be a powerful tool, and approaches to antibiotic discovery should continue to be pursued.</p>

  <title>“AI will cure cancer” misunderstands both AI and medicine</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>AI has made remarkable strides in the medical field, with capabilities including the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06555-x">detection of Parkinson’s disease via retinal images</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02361-0">identification of promising drug candidates</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06160-y">prediction of hospital readmissions</a>. While these advance are exciting, I’m wary of the practical impact AI will have on patients.</p>
<p>I recently watched a late-night talk show where skeptics and enthusiasts debated AI safety. Despite their conflicting views, there was one thing they could all agree upon. “AI will cure cancer,” one panelist declared, and everyone else confidently echoed their agreement. This collective optimism strikes me as overly idealistic and raises concerns about a failure to grapple with the realities of healthcare.</p>

<p>My reservations about AI in medicine stem from two core issues: First, the medical system often disregards patient perspectives, inherently limiting our comprehension of medical conditions. Second, AI is used to disproportionately benefit the privileged while worsening inequality. In many instances, claims like “AI will cure cancer” are being invoked as little more than superficial marketing slogans. To understand why, it is first necessary to understand how AI is used, and how the medical system operates.</p>
<section id="how-automated-decision-making-is-used" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-automated-decision-making-is-used">How Automated Decision Making is Used</h2>
<p>Automated computer systems, often involving AI, are increasingly being used to make decisions that have a big impact on people’s lives: determining who gets jobs, housing, or healthcare. Disturbing patterns are found across numerous countries and a range of systems: there is typically no way to surface or correct errors, and all too often the goal is to increase corporate and government revenues by denying poor people resources they need to survive.</p>
<p>A woman in France had her food benefits reduced by a computer program and can no longer afford enough to eat. She talked to a program officer, who said <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/11/10/how-eus-flawed-artificial-intelligence-regulation-endangers-social-safety-net">the cut was due to an error in the computer program</a>, but was unable to change it. She did not have her food benefits reinstated. The system was designed such that the computer is always considered correct, even when humans recognize an error. This woman was not alone; she was one of 60,000 people who went hungry due to these errors.</p>

<p>A man in Australia was told that he had been overpaid welfare benefits and that he was now in debt to the government. The debt was an error, based on an intentionally faulty calculation as part of the computational RoboDebt program. However, the man had no way to contest it. Despondent, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/20/platitudes-and-false-words-mother-of-robodebt-victim-who-took-own-life-tells-inquiry-of-government-stonewalling">he died by suicide</a>. This was not a one-off incident. The Australian government was later found to have wrongly created debts for hundreds of thousands of people.They were putting poor people into debt with a flawed calculation system, ruining lives efficiently at scale. The government had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/29/robodebt-government-to-repay-470000-unlawful-centrelink-debts-worth-721m">increased the number of poor people it put into debt</a> each week by 50x, compared to before RoboDebt.</p>
<p>A woman in the USA with cerebral palsy needed a health aid to help her get out of bed in the morning, to get her meals, and to complete other basic tasks. Her care was drastically <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy">cut due to a computer bug</a>. She was given no explanation and no option for recourse as her quality of life drastically plummeted. Only through a lengthy court case was it finally revealed that many people with cerebral palsy had wrongly lost their care due to a computer error.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="patterns-in-automated-decision-making">Patterns in Automated Decision Making</h2>
<p>These examples always flow in the same direction. <a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/nmlr/vol50/iss3/2/">Professor Alvaro Bedoya</a>, the founding director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center, wrote “<em>It is a pattern throughout history that surveillance is used against those considered ‘less than’, against the poor man, the person of color, the immigrant, the heretic. It is used to try to stop marginalized people from achieving power.</em>” The same pattern is found in the role of technology in decision systems.</p>
<p>The goal of many automated decision systems is to increase revenues for governments and private companies. When this is applied to health and medicine, the goal is often achieved by denying poor people food or medical care. People often trust computers to be more accurate than humans, in a bias known as automation bias. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3240751/">systematic review of 74 research studies</a> found that automation bias exists across a range of fields, including healthcare, exerting a consistent influence. This bias can make it harder for people to recognize errors in automated decision-making. Moreover, implementing mechanisms to identify and correct errors is often seen as an unnecessary expense.</p>
<p>In all of the cases above, the people most impacted (those losing access to needed food or medical care, or unjustly being thrown into debt) recognized the errors in the system earliest. Yet the systems were built with no mechanism for recognizing mistakes, for allowing the participation of those impacted, nor for providing recourse to those harmed. Unfortunately, this can also be the case in medicine.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-the-medical-system-operates">How the Medical System Operates</h2>
<p>An AI algorithm that reads MRIs more accurately would not have helped neurologist Ilene Ruhoy, MD, PhD, when she developed a 7 cm brain tumor. The key obstacle to her treatment was getting fellow neurologists to believe her symptoms and even order an MRI in the first place. “<em>I was told I knew too much, that I was working too hard, that I was stressed out, that I was anxious</em>,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/women-pain-gender-bias-doctors/">Dr.&nbsp;Ruhoy recounts</a>. Eventually, after her symptoms worsened further, she was able to get an MRI and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/women/features/women-doctors-symptoms-dismissed">urgently sent in for a 7 hour surgery</a>. Because of the delay in her diagnosis, her tumor was so large that it could not be completely removed, which has led to it growing back since her first surgery.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Ruhoy’s experience is sadly common. While Dr.&nbsp;Ruhoy lives in the USA, a study in the UK found that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180523-how-gender-bias-affects-your-healthcare">almost 1 in 3 patients with brain tumors</a> had to visit doctors at least 5 times before receiving an accurate diagnosis. Again, MRI-reading AI can not help these patients whose doctors won’t order an MRI in the first place. On average, it takes <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumap/article/4/1/rkaa006/5758274">Lupus patients 7 years</a> to receive a correct diagnosis, and 1 in 3 are initially misdiagnosed with doctors incorrectly claiming mental health issues are the root of their symptoms. Even healthcare workers are often shocked at how quickly they are dismissed and disbelieved once they become patients. For instance, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/health-care-workers-long-covid-are-being-dismissed/620801/">interviews with a dozen healthcare workers</a> revealed that their colleagues shifted to discarding their expertise as soon as they developed Long Covid.</p>

</div>
<p>This disregard of patient experience and patient expertise severely limits medical knowledge. It results in delayed diagnoses, misdiagnoses, missing data, and incorrect data. AI is great at finding patterns in existing data. However, AI will not be able to solve this problem of missing and erroneous underlying data. Furthermore, there is a negative feedback loop around lack of medical data for poorly understood diseases: doctors disbelieve patients and dismiss them as anxious or complaining too much, failing to gather data which could help illuminate the disease.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-wrong-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-wrong-data">The Wrong Data</h2>
<p>Even worse, often research problems are reformulated to shoe-horn inadequate data sources in. Analyzing electronic health record data is cheaper than searching for new causal mechanisms. Medical data is often limited by the categories of billing codes, by what doctors choose to note from a patient’s account, and what tests are ordered. The data are inherently incomplete.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180518-the-inequality-in-how-women-are-treated-for-pain">Medical bias</a> is widespread, with studies documenting that doctors give <a href="https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/13/2/150/1935962">less pain medication to Black patients</a> than to white patients for the same conditions. On average, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180523-how-gender-bias-affects-your-healthcare">women have to wait months or years longer</a> than men to get an accurate diagnosis for the same conditions. This impacts the data that is collected and will be used for AI. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/D17-1323/">Multiple research studies</a> have shown that AI not only encodes existing biases, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09451">can also amplify their magnitude</a>. At heart, these biases often pivot on not believing marginalized people about their experiences: not believing when they say that they are in pain nor how they report their symptoms.</p>

<p>On a deeper level, ignoring patient expertise limits what hypotheses are devised, and can slow research progress. These issues will propagate into AI, unless researchers seek ways to include meaningful patient participation. These problems are not unique to any one country or any one type of medical system. Patients across the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada (the 4 countries I am most familiar with) are all well-documented to experience these issues.</p>

<section id="being-honest-about-the-risks-and-opportunities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="being-honest-about-the-risks-and-opportunities">Being Honest About the Risks and Opportunities</h2>
<p>While AI holds transformative possibilities for medicine, it is important that we are clear-eyed about both the risks and the opportunities. Many talks on Medical AI give the impression that the only thing holding medicine back is a lack of knowledge. The many other factors that influence medical care, including the systematic disregard for patients’ knowledge of their own experiences, are often ignored in these discussions. Ignoring these realities will lead people to design AI for an idealized medical system that does not exist. There is already a clear pattern in which AI is used to centralize power and harm the marginalized. In medicine, this could lead to patients, who are already disempowered and often disregarded, having even less autonomy or voice.</p>
<p>In my view, some of the most promising areas of research are participatory approaches to machine learning and patient-led medical research. The <a href="https://participatoryml.github.io/">Participatory Approaches to Machine Learning workshop at ICML</a> included a powerful collection of talks and papers on both the need and the opportunities for designing systems with greater participation of those impacted. AI ethics work on topics of contestability (building in ways for participants to contest outputs) and actionable recourse are necessary. For medical research more generally, the <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/">Patient Led Research Collaborative</a> (focused on Long Covid) is an encouraging model. I hope that we can see more efforts within medical AI to center patient expertise.</p>

  <title>How Immune Cells Communicate</title>
  <dc:creator>Rachel Thomas</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>This post is part 2 in a series. Be sure to <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-01-23-cytokines1/">read part 1 here</a>.</em></p>
<p>A key obstacle hindering medical research for a range of diseases is our lack of understanding of the immune system. <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/human-immunome">Harvard Professor Wayne Koff described</a> his decades of HIV research, “<em>slowly, over time, we began to see that we understood a lot about HIV at the molecular level, but we didn’t know anything about ourselves. And the reason is that the immune system is incredibly complex</em>.”</p>
<p>Many diseases involve the immune system overreacting, underreacting, or having a mistargeted reaction. Deepening our understanding of the immune system is crucial for better understanding and treating a range of diseases. In <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-01-23-cytokines1/">part 1 of this series</a>, I shared about the networks by which immune cells communicate and coordinate via the use of protein messengers called <em>cytokines</em>. These networks are complex and not fully mapped. Studying these networks is part of determining how and why the immune system reacts as it does. Here, I will share some more research on immune cell-cytokine networks.</p>
<section id="immune-cells-coordinate-like-a-social-network" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="immune-cells-coordinate-like-a-social-network">Immune Cells Coordinate Like a Social Network</h2>
<p>Immune cells and the cytokines they use to communicate can be analyzed using the same techniques as are used for social networks. Networks can be represented as matrices, in which each column/row represents a node, and the matrix values represent the presence or strength of connections between them. This type of representation underlies how the network of the internet is represented for search engines such as Google. Matrix math is everywhere! I covered many applications of it in the computational linear algebra course that Jeremy Howard and I designed and taught at University of San Francisco and fast.ai.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ni.3693">paper ImmProt</a> sampled immune cells from the bloodstream of humans and used proteomics (the large-scale analysis of proteins) to study immune communication networks. The researchers considered 28 cell types in both steady and activated states, and over 10,000 proteins. ImmProt used several classic math techniques to analyze the network, including principal component analysis, supervised clustering, and Lasso regression analysis.</p>
<p>Cytokines bind to receptors on the surface of the cell that is receiving them. Receptors for some cytokines are found on many different types of immune cells (these receptors are said to be “broadly expressed”), while receptors for other cytokines may be expressed on a very limited number of cell types. The researchers found that there were two types of cytokine communication patterns: there were either many types of cells sending and few types receiving for a given cytokine, or there were few types of cells sending and many receiving. This is a directed, asymmetric information exchange.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">A single type of message (in this case, CCL5/3) can be sent to many different cells (figure 6h from ImmProt)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The authors looked at the number of in-going and out-going communication between various cell types, and determined how much cross-talk there is between different clusters of cell types. In the above diagram, the outer circle lists cell types and the middle circle lists receptor and cytokine gene names. This picture shows that eosinophils and basophils (two cell types that evolved primarily to address parasites) send the cytokine CCL5/3 to a variety of other cells that receive the message using the receptor CCR3. The color of the lines indicates the type of cell sending the cytokine.</p>
<p>While many of the relationships found were well established in existing scientific papers, they also discovered new relationships, and validated two of these new relationships experimentally: one in-going and one out-going. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ni.3693">The authors wrote</a>, “<em>The immune system displays an almost infinite diversity in cell types and activation states, and achieving completeness in both dimensions is particularly challenging for human cells</em>.”</p>

<p>AI is a powerful tool, but it does not replace other ways of knowing about the world, including <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2022-06-01-qualitative/">qualitative research</a> (as I wrote about together with Louisa Bartolo) and benchtop quantitative experiments. Machine learning and AI techniques are great at learning patterns in existing data. However, they are limited by what types of data have been collected so far, and it is still crucial to continue running new laboratory-based experiments. For this reason, the recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06816-9">Immune Dictionary paper</a> was a valuable contribution to the field. The researchers gathered direct measurements of over &gt;1,400 cytokine-cell type pairings in an in vivo experiment.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Steps for creating a dictionary of immune gene expression signatures (Figure 1A from Immune Dictionary)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This study was significant because it considered all major immune cell types and all major cytokines (studies typically look at only 5 immune cell types) and was conducted in vivo (not in a culture). The researchers injected 86 different cytokines into individual mice and measured the responses of 17 types of immune cells in the mouse lymph nodes. They used single-cell RNA sequencing, which is more direct than considering ligand and receptor expression association data. They released their findings as an “Immune Dictionary” and developed <a href="https://www.immune-dictionary.org/app/home">accompanying computer software</a>. This software was then used to identify cytokine networks in tumors after checkpoint blockade therapy (a cancer therapy that helps to reactivate exhausted immune cells).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06816-9">One key finding</a> was that the responses induced by cytokines are highly cell-specific. Rarer types of immune cells expressed a greater number of cytokine types than more common cell types. One rare cell type, typically not even covered in immunology courses, was found to express the highest number of distinct cytokines, influencing nearly every other cell type. This result suggests that rare immune cell types are crucial for cell-to-cell communication.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Software for the dictionary of 17+ immune cell types responding to 86 cytokines in vivo</figcaption>

</div>
<p>Another important finding was that every immune cell type could be polarized into multiple states depending on the combination of cytokines that it received. The <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/new-dictionary-immune-responses-reveals-far-more-complexity-immune-system-previously-thought">two key researchers were surprised</a> at this level of plasticity and complexity in immune cell types, with even the most well-studied cytokines inducing more complex responses than previously expected.</p>

<p>This is an exciting area of research to follow. There is still much work to be done in more thoroughly understanding the intricate and complex ways immune cells coordinate with one another to respond to threats. Immune cell-cytokine networks are a great illustration of the power of interdisciplinary work, since NLP, mathematics, and bench top immunology research all provide important insights into the problem. And this is just one of several important problems in immunology where AI is being applied!</p>

<section id="the-value-of-domain-expertise" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-value-of-domain-expertise">The value of domain expertise</h2>
<p>Back in 2016, Jeremy Howard and I founded the research lab <a href="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2016-10-07-fastai-launch.html">fast.ai</a>. At the time, deep learning (the technique behind recent advances in AI) was the purview of a small and homogeneous handful of practitioners. The standard approach was to have computer science PhDs tackle problems in domains they had little familiarity with.</p>
<p>Jeremy and I proposed an ambitious idea–we wanted to teach people from all domains and backgrounds to be able to use deep learning. We weren’t even sure if our goal was possible. However, <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">our online course</a> became one of the most popular deep learning courses in the world, and members of the fast.ai community went on to join top research labs and major tech companies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17316010/fast-ai-speed-test-stanford-dawnbench-google-intel">win competitions against Google</a>, and launch their own startups.</p>
<p>A core part of our mission was the belief that the people closest to a topic best understand the problems in that area and are best equipped to address them. I’m now one of those people in another domain, as I have <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2023-02-07-school-immunology/">immersed myself in the field of immunology</a>. I am particularly interested in studying the intersection of immunology and AI. In this 2-part series, I will share some exciting research at this intersection.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-most-complicated-system" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-most-complicated-system">A Most Complicated System</h2>
<p>The immune system is even “more complicated than the human genome,” <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/human-immunome">says John Tsang</a>, a professor at Yale School of Medicine. One component of this complexity is the complicated network by which immune cells communicate with one another via protein messengers known as <em>cytokines</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>Immune cell communication through cytokines is a key area for us to better understand medicine and disease. Various immune cell types must communicate to coordinate their response to threats. However, the immune system may end up over-reacting, under-reacting, or having a misplaced reaction, all of which can cause disease. Sepsis occurs when the immune system responds too vigorously, damaging our own organs. In cancer, the immune system may under-respond, failing to attack cancerous cells that it should. Several types of cancer therapies involve trying to activate or reactivate our own immune cells. In other cases, the immune system mistakenly attacks our own tissue, causing autoimmune diseases including Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis.</p>
<p>Recent research, drawing on a blend of immunology, mathematics, and natural language processing (NLP) AI, is helping us better understand immune cell-cytokine networks. I have a PhD in math, taught a <a href="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2019-07-08-fastai-nlp.html">masters course in NLP</a>, and <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2023-02-07-school-immunology/">now study immunology</a>, so I have a particular interest in this work. Understanding how the immune system is communicating and coordinating is necessary for knowing why and how the immune response can go awry.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-immune-cells-communicate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-immune-cells-communicate">How Immune Cells Communicate</h2>
<p>There are dozens of types of immune cells. The main way that immune cells communicate and coordinate with each other is by sending small protein messengers known as cytokines. There are hundreds of types of cytokines. A single cytokine can have different effects on different cell types. The impact of a cytokine depends on the type of cell sending it, the type of cell receiving it, and the state of the cell. This makes interpreting immune responses challenging!</p>
<p>Cytokine-based therapies are used to treat some diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. The interactions between cells and cytokines form complex networks, which are not fully mapped.</p>
<p><em>Note: You may have heard the term “cytokine storm” in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm-immune-system.html">the news</a> during early coverage of covid (other diseases and some medical treatments can lead to cytokine storms as well). A cytokine storm occurs when the immune system reacts too vigorously, sending tons of messages and ramping up its inflammatory response to a level that is dangerous to the patient. The double-edged nature of the immune system is part of what piqued my interest about the topic.</em></p>

<section id="nlp-for-cell-cytokine-interactions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nlp-for-cell-cytokine-interactions">NLP for Cell-Cytokine Interactions</h2>
<p>Language models such as ChatGPT are part of the active field Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP applies data science and machine learning to collections of text documents. At fast.ai, Jeremy Howard, Sylvain Gugger, and I developed a <a href="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2019-07-08-fastai-nlp.html">course on NLP in 2019</a>, teaching cutting edge techniques like transformers, which are now used in ChatGPT and other popular models.</p>
<p>One paper in immunology is published every 30 minutes! That is a lot of immunology papers, and NLP techniques can be used to help synthesize this huge quantity of information. While models like ChatGPT are trained using a huge variety of texts scraped from the internet, immune-focused work may focus on a more specific group of documents, such as PubMed abstracts. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4152">A computer program called ImmuneXpresso</a> was developed to text-mine the 16 million abstracts available on PubMed and create triples containing a cell type, cytokine, and whether the relationship was in-coming or out-going (i.e.&nbsp;if the cell was sending or receiving the cytokine).</p>

<p>The above figure from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4152">ImmuneXpresso paper</a> shows some of the information flow. Each family of cytokines shown contains multiple cytokines, and each family of cells contains multiple sub-types. The researchers relied on sentence syntax to parse these relationships, and captured associations with 188 diseases. A machine learning classifier was used to predict whether the data captured were related to cell-cytokine relationships. Over 4,000 directional cell–cytokine interactions were documented via this process. The authors experimentally tested two interactions that were predicted, but are not well-established in the literature, and validated that they hold true.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-famous-data-scientist-turns-to-immunology">A famous data scientist turns to immunology</h2>
<p>Jeff Hammerbacher created and led the data team at Facebook in 2006-2008 and was a founder of the successful cloud computing company Cloudera. A decade ago he made a similar pivot to the one I am currently attempting, starting <a href="https://www.hammerlab.org/">his own immunology lab</a> at Mt. Sinai and later the Medical University of South Carolina. He has applied machine learning to a variety of immunology problems, including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26856372/">predicting surgery outcomes</a>, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01807/full">designing cancer vaccines</a>, and starting a <a href="https://www.related.vc/">data science focused drug-discovery firm</a>.</p>
<p>Hammerbacher, together with Ed Czech, tackled the problem of <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/643767v2">using NLP to extract cell type-cytokine relationships</a>. To give an example of the type of problems that must be addressed in NLP, “<em>Th1 (CD4+IL-17-IFN-γhi) cells</em>” is referring to the same cell type as “<em>helper CD4+IL-17-IFN-γhi type 1 cells</em>.” Expert knowledge must be encoded in how to properly parse and categorize cells, knowing when two different strings refer to the same cell type and when they are different.</p>

<p>They compared two different deep learning models. In one case, they used a generative model with weak supervision, which allowed for them to begin with a smaller labeled dataset to generate labels for previously unlabeled data. In the other case, they used a language model (SciBERT) which had been pre-trained on scientific texts, and then they fine-tuned it for the specific PubMed immunology articles they were using. This is an example of <strong>transfer learning</strong>, a technique in which a machine learning model trained on a large dataset can be customized for use on a much smaller dataset. Transfer learning has been a central part of the fast.ai approach from the start, and was a key technique I featured in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frc7FgheUj4&amp;list=PLtmWHNX-gukLQlMvtRJ19s7-8MrnRV6h6&amp;index=11">keynotes at JupyterCon 2017</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KChtdexd5Jo&amp;list=PLtmWHNX-gukLQlMvtRJ19s7-8MrnRV6h6&amp;index=6">SciPy 2019</a>.</p>
<p>As part of Czech and Hammerbacher’s research, they created a database of T-cell specific cytokines and transcription factors, including relationships between 75 cell types, 262 cytokines, and 382 transcription factors. Their work was distinctive for having a tiny team (just 2 people, compared to 16 authors and 11 annotators for ImmuneXpresso), using 53k full-text documents (rather than solely abstracts), and focusing more narrowly on T-cells (as opposed to all immune cells). Techniques such as transfer learning are powerful in that they allow small teams of researchers to leverage previous models via fine-tuning. In addition to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/643767v2">the paper</a>, Hammerbacher shared about this work in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvj9tIdvOXQ">talk he gave at the Allen Institute for AI</a>.</p>

  <title>4 Things I Learned About Bugs</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I am currently halfway through my Masters of Microbiology &amp; Immunology. My goal is to apply my previous decade of experience as a data scientist and AI researcher to immunology. Even though my primary interest is on long-term impacts of viruses on humans, I wanted a broader and deeper understanding of microbiology in general. This past semester, I was pleasantly surprised to learn several fascinating facts about insects!</p>
<section id="insects-are-useful-for-making-medications-and-vaccines" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="insects-are-useful-for-making-medications-and-vaccines">Insects are useful for making medications and vaccines</h2>
<p>Proteins are a key component of many vaccines and medications. To create these proteins, scientists have come up with a range of <strong>protein expression systems</strong>. Bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells, and genetically modified animals can all be used to produce proteins for medications. And so can insects! For instance, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1095">baculovirus is a virus</a> that mostly infects insects, and its genome can be modified to produce various cytokines (chemical messengers), antivirals (such as type 1 interferons), and vaccine components.</p>
<p>There are trade-offs with any choice of protein expression system. For example, <em>bacteria</em> are fast and cheap to use, but because they are quite dissimilar to humans, they are much worse for key steps such as protein folding or adding sugars to proteins (a process called glycosylation). And while <em>mammalian</em> cells or genetically modified animals will produce much more accurately folded proteins and glycosylation, they are expensive and slow for production. Baculoviruses from insects aren’t the worst in any of these categories, which makes them a widely useful workhorse for protein expression.</p>
<p>Insect cells are more similar to human cells than yeast or bacteria are, which means that the proteins they produce (when infected with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159335/">modified baculoviruses</a>) are more likely to be folded correctly, and they make for cheaper and faster expression systems than mammalian cells do. A baculovirus expression system is used, for example, to produce Novavax, a popular protein-based covid vaccine (which may have fewer side-effects than mRNA-based covid vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="insects-have-the-same-problems-humans-do-viral-bacterial-fungal-and-protozoan-infections">Insects have the same problems humans do: viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections</h2>
<p>Insects can be infected with harmful viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. <strong>Entomopathogens</strong> is a fun vocabulary word for pathogens that infect arthropods (arthropods include insects, mites, ticks, spiders, and more). These are sometimes used as natural pesticides, in order to try to control insect pests that may be feeding on crops or spreading disease. <a href="https://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=24119">Entomopathogens may kill, limit reproduction, or shorten the life of arthropod pests</a>. They are generally less toxic to humans and other animals than other pesticides, although it is a risk that they could spread to related species.</p>

<section id="insects-really-need-the-bacteria-in-their-guts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="insects-really-need-the-bacteria-in-their-guts">Insects really need the bacteria in their guts</h2>
<p>While some bacteria are harmful to insects, other bacteria are not only beneficial, but even essential. A diet consisting only of sap is not nutritionally complete. Neither is a diet just of blood. Some arthropods can’t produce all the vitamins they need, and instead rely on bacteria in their guts to help synthesize essential vitamins. These bacteria (known as obligate symbionts) rely on their hosts as well, in a mutually beneficial relationship. Bioinformatics and modern gene sequencing has revolutionized the study of these obligate symbionts by allowing for their genomes to be sequenced and studied. One paper calls them the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24995872/">“The Tiniest Tiny Genomes”</a>, and describes how through a long process of coevolution the bacteria lost the genes to manufacture cell membrane components. They are completely reliant on their hosts, while also producing B vitamins and essential amino acids.</p>
<p>While many types of bacteria help bugs synthesize nutrients, other types can help synthesize protective toxins to be used against predators. Diaphorina is an insect pest of citrus plants. Profftella, one of the bacterial obligate symbionts in its gut, is noteworthy for helping to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32797185/">synthesize both vitamins and protective toxins</a> for its host, whereas many symbionts provide either vitamins or toxins, but not both.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-common-bacteria-in-insects-reduces-risk-of-dengue-virus-to-humans">A common bacteria in insects reduces risk of Dengue Virus to humans</h2>
<p>An astonishing <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/mosquito-control/community/emerging-methods/wolbachia.html">60% of insects</a> (including butterflies, bees, and beetles) around the world have the bacteria Wolbachia. This fascinating bacteria can have some surprising impacts, including reducing the ability of mosquitoes to carry or transmit dengue virus.</p>
<p><em>A. aegypti</em> mosquitoes are carriers of dengue virus. They do not naturally carry Wolbachia, but when mosquitoes with Wolbachia were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42336-2">released in North Queensland, Australia</a>, predicted transmission of dengue infections dropped by 95% over the following 2 years. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2030243">A randomized study in Indonesia</a> released Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in some regions but not others, and found the regions with the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes had 77% fewer dengue cases.</p>
<p>Another surprising effect of the bacteria is that a male mosquito with Wolbachia mates with a female mosquito that doesn’t have it, the fertilized eggs will not be viable. And two mosquitoes with different strains of Wolbachia can not produce viable eggs. Isn’t this weird??? This has been used in some efforts to reduce mosquito populations.</p>

  <title>AI and Power: The Ethical Challenges of Automation, Centralization, and Scale</title>
  <dc:creator>Rachel Thomas</dc:creator>
  <link>https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2023-05-16-ai-centralizes-power/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Friends with no previous interest in AI ethics have begun asking me questions in the wake of the release of ChatGPT4, Bard, and Bing Chat. This new generation of large language models <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/technology/ai-chat-bot-chatgpt.html">has made headlines</a> and sparked widespread debate. To consider the risks posed by new AI applications, it is useful to first understand several underlying concepts. <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/about.html">I spent years</a> researching the mechanisms by which algorithmic systems can cause harm, and in late 2021, I gave a 20-minute talk on what I consider key ideas at the heart of AI ethics. With the advent of the newest generation of language models, these concepts are more relevant than ever.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, topics such as <em>explainability</em> (having computers generate an explanation of why they compute the outputs they do) and <em>fairness/bias</em> (addressing when algorithms have worse accuracy on some groups of people than others) have gained more attention within the field of AI and in the media. Some computer scientists and journalists have stopped there: assuming that a computer program that can explain the logic behind its decision making, or a program that has the same accuracy on light-skinned men as on dark-skinned women, must now be ethical. While these principles are important, on their own they are not enough to address nor prevent harms of AI systems.</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>Below is an edited transcript of this talk.</p>
<section id="actionable-recourse" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="actionable-recourse">Actionable Recourse</h2>
<p><em>Explainability</em> on its own is insufficient. Consider an algorithmic system that is making decisions about whether or not someone should get a loan. Often a question will be “why was my loan denied?”, but really the underlying question is “what can I change about my situation to get a loan in the future?”</p>
<p>An explanation should be <em>actionable</em>. For example, it’s not okay to deny a loan because of ethnicity. That’s discrimination and it would not make for a satisfying explanation. For decisions impacting people’s lives, there also needs to be a mechanism for <em>recourse</em>, so that decisions can be changed. This is <em>actionable recourse</em>, as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06514">described by Berk Ustun</a>.</p>
<p>This underlying idea of actionable recourse shows up in many applications. There is an example I return to often, since it’s a pattern that we see across many countries. In the USA there is an algorithm to determine poor people’s health care benefits. When it was implemented in one state there was a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy">bug in the code that incorrectly cut care</a> for people with cerebral palsy. Tammy Dobbs was one of the many people that lost care due to a software bug. She needed this care for very basic life functions: to help her get out of bed in the morning, to get her breakfast, and so on. She asked for an explanation and they didn’t give her one; they just said this is what the algorithm determined. At the root, what she needed was not just an explanation, but a mechanism for recourse to get the decision changed. Eventually the error was revealed through a lengthy court case, but that is a terrible setup.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">When an algorithm cuts your health care</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This illustrates a common issue that shows up again and again: <strong>automated systems are often implemented with no way to identify and address mistakes</strong>.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why there is no mechanism for catching mistakes. Often automation is being used as a cost cutting measure and having robust error checking in place and ways to surface mistakes would cost more. There can also be biases of people mistakenly believing that computers are perfectly accurate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/11/10/how-eus-flawed-artificial-intelligence-regulation-endangers-social-safety-net">Human Rights Watch put out a report</a> on automated system use in the EU for social benefits. Country after country had alarming examples where there were errors, yet no clear way to identify, much less address, them. There was a case in France where an algorithm to determine food benefits made errors in at least 60,000 cases. One woman said her case manager even agreed this was a bug and that she deserved to receive benefits, but the case manager didn’t have the power to reinstate them!</p>

</div>
<p>Another domain to consider is content moderation. The <a href="https://santaclaraprinciples.org/">Santa Clara Principles for content moderation</a> were developed by a group of ethicists, although these principles are not observed by the major platforms. I want to share Principle 3, because I love the wording, which is that companies should provide a <em>meaningful opportunity for timely appeal</em>. I really like this idea of appeal being <em>meaningful</em> and <em>timely</em>. I think this is relevant far, far beyond content moderation. Too often, even when there is a way to try to report a mistake, you just get an automated response that clearly hasn’t been read or you have to wait months for an answer. It is important that appeals are not just available, but also that they are meaningful and timely.</p>
</section>
<section id="contestability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contestability">Contestability</h2>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3311957.3359435"><em>Contestability</em></a> is the idea of building an algorithmic system to include mechanisms for questioning and disagreeing with results as part of the system, rather than as an external add-on. Too often we build computational systems assuming okay this is going to work great, and then when there are errors, we tack on something extra at the end. I found this provocative to think about how we <strong>include disagreement into the core of the system</strong>.</p>
<p>I had considered this from a slightly different angle in my work with fast.ai, where we have a concept of what we call <em>augmented machine learning</em>. This is in contrast to auto machine learning, which is often about automating a process end to end. With <a href="https://slideslive.com/38917533/lessons-learned-from-helping-200000-nonml-experts-use-ml">augmented machine learning</a> we really wanted to think about what are the things that humans are really good at and how can we take advantage of human strengths as opposed to simply trying to automate everything and then being left with weird gaps of stuff that computers are not doing well. How can humans and computers best work together? This is important to keep in mind with system design.</p>
</section>
<section id="fairness-and-bias" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fairness-and-bias">Fairness and Bias</h2>
<p>It is important to consider fairness and bias, but that alone is insufficient. I imagine many of you are familiar with the <a href="http://gendershades.org/overview.html">Gender Shades research</a> on facial recognition by Joy Boulamwini, Timnit Gebru, and Deborah Raji. They evaluated commercial computer vision products that had been released from a number of big name companies including Microsoft, IBM, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/amazon-facial-technology-study.html">Amazon</a>. They found that the products performed worse on women than on men and worse on people with dark skin than on people with light skin, leading to terrible results for dark-skinned women. For instance, IBM’s product had 99.7% accuracy on light skinned men, but just 65% accuracy on dark-skinned women. That is a huge discrepancy in a product that had been commercially released. This research was ground-breaking in bringing attention to a pernicious issue.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Results from one of the GenderShades studies</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Some people have reacted with a superficial response, which is not consistent what the researchers wrote, concluding that the solution is solely to get more pictures of dark-skinned women and then call it a day. While issues of representation in underlying training datasets need to be addressed, this is only one part of the problem. We have to look at how these systems are used, which poses many other significant harms.</p>
</section>
<section id="harmful-if-it-doesnt-work-harmful-if-it-works" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="harmful-if-it-doesnt-work-harmful-if-it-works">Harmful if it doesn’t work; Harmful if it works</h2>
<p>In several USA cities, <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/investigations/miami-police-used-facial-recognition-technology-in-protesters-arrest/2278848/">police have</a> used <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373316/nypd-facial-recognition-black-lives-matter-activist-derrick-ingram">facial recognition</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/11/13243890/facebook-twitter-instagram-police-surveillance-geofeedia-api">identify Black people</a> protesting police racism and police murders of unarmed civilians. There’s a huge power issue when you look at this type of use of technology. I believe this is unethical whether or not it works. It is certainly terrible to misidentify people and arrest the wrong person, but it’s a threat to civil rights to identify protesters.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-bias.html">Dr.&nbsp;Timnit Gebru wrote</a>, <em>“A lot of times, people are talking about bias in the sense of equalizing performance across groups. They’re not thinking about the underlying foundation, whether a task should exist in the first place, who creates it, who will deploy it on which population, who owns the data, and how is it used?”</em> These are all crucial questions to ask. They are questions of power. Yes, you should check the error rates on different subgroups, but that alone is insufficient, and doesn’t address questions of power.</p>
<p>While the policing examples are from the USA, this is a pattern throughout history and throughout the world. <a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/nmlr/vol50/iss3/2/">Professor Alvaro Bedoya wrote</a>, <em>“It is a pattern throughout history that surveillance is used against those considered ‘less than’, against the poor man, the person of color, the immigrant, the heretic. It is used to try to stop marginalized people from achieving power.”</em> The history of surveillance as a weapon used against the marginalised stretches back centuries and predates computers, but <strong>AI has now turbocharged this dynamic</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="operating-at-scale" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="operating-at-scale">Operating at scale</h2>
<p>Robodebt was a program where the Australian government created unlawful debts for hundreds of thousands of people through an automated system. People would be notified that they had been overpaid on welfare (often, this was false, but contesting it required documentation most people didn’t have) and that they now owed the government significant amounts of money. This destroyed many lives, even driving some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/20/platitudes-and-false-words-mother-of-robodebt-victim-who-took-own-life-tells-inquiry-of-government-stonewalling">victims to suicide</a>. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/29/robodebt-government-to-repay-470000-unlawful-centrelink-debts-worth-721m">detail that struck me</a> is that the number of debts issued went from 20,000 <em>per year</em>, back when it was a more manual process, to 20,000 <em>per week</em> with automation. That is a 50x scale up! <strong>Automation was used to drastically scale putting poor people into debt</strong>. This is another disturbing pattern in machine learning.</p>
</section>
<section id="centralizing-power" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="centralizing-power">Centralizing Power</h2>
<p>Machine learning often has the effect of centralizing power. It can be implemented with no system for recourse and no way to identify mistakes, as we saw earlier with people whose <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy">healthcare was wrongly cut due to a bug</a>. It can be used cheaply at massive scale, as shown with Robodebt. It can also replicate identical biases or errors at scale.</p>
<p>Often when I teach about how automated systems can cause harm, <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2018-08-07-hbr-bias-algorithms/">people will point out</a> how humans make mistakes and are biased too. However, there are key differences in automated systems. It is not just plug-and-play interchangeable when you switch from a human decision maker to an automated decision maker.</p>
<p>Automated systems can also be used to evade responsibility. This is true of bureaucracy in general. While in non-automated bureaucracies you also get a passing of the buck (“I was just following orders” or ”it’s this other person’s fault”); however, as dana boyd has pointed out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTl0yyPqf3E">automated systems are often being used to extend bureaucracy</a> (as explained by danah boyd), adding additional places to deflect responsibility.</p>
<p>In the example health care software bug example that I shared, a journalist interviewed the creator of that algorithm. He is earning royalties through a private company, and he said it’s not the company’s responsibility to offer an explanation. He blamed policymakers for the errors. The policymakers could blame the particular people that implemented this software. Everyone can point to somebody else or even to the software itself. Systems where nobody takes responsibility do not lead to good outcomes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feedback-loops">Feedback loops</h2>
<p>Feedback loops occur when you create the outcome that you were trying to predict. Data can become tainted from the output of the model. Furthermore, machine learning models can amplify bias, not just encode it. There have been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09451">multiple papers</a> showing that if <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/machines-taught-by-photos-learn-a-sexist-view-of-women/">you start</a> with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09847">a biased dataset</a> you can actually train a model that is even <strong>more</strong> biased than the training dataset.</p>

<p>In summary, these are several reasons why machine learning can end up centralising power and why automated systems are different from human decision makers. AI researcher Pratyusha Kalluri advises us that rather than ask whether an AI application is fair to instead <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02003-2">ask how it shifts power</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-people-impacted">The People Impacted</h2>
<p>Another thing I want to highlight about the healthcare example is that the people whose healthcare was incorrectly cut saw the problem right away, but there was no way to get that mistake acknowledged or addressed.</p>
<p>Another tragic example of people recognizing an issue but not being able to get it addressed is Facebook’s role in the genocide in Myanmar. In 2018, the UN found that Facebook had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook-idUSKCN1GO2PN">played a “determining role”</a> in the genocide; however that was not not a surprise to anyone who had been following the events. A tech entepreneur <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-facebooks-rise-fueled-chaos-and-confusion-in-myanmar/">based in Myanmar said</a>, “That’s not 20/20 hindsight. The scale of this problem was significant. It was already apparent [going back to 2013].”</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Articles about the role of Facebook in the Myanmar genocide</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It’s important to understand that genocide does not come out of nowhere. It gradually escalates. From 2013, people warned executives about how Facebook was being used in Myanmar to incite violence and to dehumanize an ethnic minority. In 2013, 2014, and 2015, people raised warnings and they were not listened to.</p>
<p>An indication of how little Facebook did to address the issues is that the start of 2015 they only had two contractors who spoke Burmese, and they only hired 2 more that year. Compared to the number of Burmese-speaking users in Myanmar, it was a tiny number. Facebook invested very few resources in this (contrast the situation with when <a href="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2018-04-19-facebook.html#myanmar">Facebook rapidly hired over a thousand content moderators</a> in Germany to avoid a fine).</p>
<p>This is a pattern that we see over and over, that often the people most impacted by a system recognize the issues earliest, but they are not listened to and don’t have effective ways to raise an alarm. They also best understand the needed interventions for addressing the ethical risk. It is crucial that the people most impacted have avenues for participation and power.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practical-resources">Practical Resources</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2020/workshop/5720">participatory approaches to machine learning</a> workshop at ICML 2020 was fantastic. The organizers of the workshop highlighted that the designers of a machine learning system have far more power over the system than the individuals impacted. Even within algorithmic fairness or human-centered ML, <strong>ethics work is often focused on centralized solutions, which can further increase the power of system creators</strong>. The workshop organizers called for more democratic, cooperative, and participatory approaches.</p>
<p>I want to share some practical resources with you. The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University has a packet of resources online for ethics and technology practice and in particular I love their <a href="https://www.scu.edu/ethics-in-technology-practice/ethical-toolkit/">Tech Ethics Toolkit</a>. This is a set of practices that you could implement within your organization. As an example, tool 3 is “expanding the ethical circle”, which involves setting a regular time aside to make sure you are going through who all the stakeholders are that will be directly affected by a system, as well as who will be indirectly affected in significant ways. It involves asking whose skills, experiences, and values have we simply assumed rather than actually consulted. The toolkit goes into more detail about this on questions to ask and things to look for.</p>

  <title>Viruses: The Silent Triggers of Autoimmune and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

<p><em>This is Part 2 in a series. Read <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2023-03-07-viruses1/">Part 1 here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Your previously healthy 1-year old develops Type 1 diabetes, a condition they will have for the rest of their life and that will require constant monitoring. Your partner has a stroke. Your parent shows early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. What do these seemingly disparate health events have in common? All can be triggered by viruses where the immediate infection seems mild.</p>
<section id="a-life-changing-diagnosis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-life-changing-diagnosis">A Life-Changing Diagnosis</h2>
<p><a href="https://raisingachildwithdiabetes.com/our-story/">When Maria’s 1-year old daughter</a> came down with a cold, it initially seemed like no big deal. However, her cough lingered, and in the coming months she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, a condition which can not be cured and which her daughter will have for the rest of her life. Maria was thrust into a stressful world of needing to constantly monitor her baby’s blood sugar, where either too much or too little insulin could kill her baby.</p>
<p>In the wake of her cold, the baby’s immune system had mistakenly turned on her pancreas, permanently destroying the cells needed to generate insulin. Type 1 diabetes is not related to diet or lifestyle, and is far less predictable than the more famous type 2 diabetes. As <a href="https://raisingachildwithdiabetes.com/our-story/">Maria writes</a>, “<em>We can do the same thing every day… and all our efforts simply do not work. It’s a never-ending battle. Diabetes never takes a break and needs to be managed 24/7/365 days a year… If we give too much insulin, she can go into a coma, and if we do not give her sufficient insulin, she can go into DKA [a life-threatening condition].</em>”</p>

</div>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is often triggered by a viral infection. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0667-0">One study</a> tracked viruses in stool samples from young children, month after month, and discovered that when kids have certain common childhood viruses for consecutive months, they are at much higher risk of having their immune systems develop autoimmunity against their own pancreas (a precursor to Type 1 diabetes).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-autoimmune-diseases-and-how-do-they-relate-to-viruses">What are autoimmune diseases, and how do they relate to viruses?</h2>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is just one of many, many diseases caused by our own immune systems gone awry. These are known as <em>autoimmune diseases</em>. The Greek prefix <em>auto</em> means <em>self</em>. A key role of the immune system is to be able to distinguish between what is foreign and what is self, and it is harmful when the immune system erroneously learns to attack self. At its best, the immune system is a beautiful and complex orchestra working together for our good. However, the immune system is a double-edged sword that can cause great harm when it goes awry.</p>
<p>Despite impacting a wide range of body systems, all of the following examples are united in being autoimmune diseases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crohn’s disease occurs when the immune system attacks the colon</li>
<li>Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the immune system attacks its own antibodies</li>
<li>Multiple sclerosis occurs when the immune system attacks the protective coverings of neurons</li>
<li>Lupus occurs when the immune system attacks our own DNA</li>
<li>Hashimoto’s disease occurs when the immune system attacks the thyroid</li>
<li>Psoriasis occurs when the immune system attacks skin cells</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Autoimmune disease can impact the whole body. Image: Glover, Mishra and Singh; Creative Commons License</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There is still much that is unknown about the onset of autoimmune diseases, although in many cases, a viral infection can be the trigger (there are likely other factors involved too, including genetic predisposition). During an infection, our adaptive immune systems learn to recognize small patterns of molecules that indicate a pathogen or infected cell. Unfortunately, if these small patterns appear similar to elements of our own bodies, the body may continue attacking itself even once the acute infection is over.</p>
</section>
<section id="obstacles-in-research-and-treatment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="obstacles-in-research-and-treatment">Obstacles in research and treatment</h2>
<p>Women are more likely to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091302214000466">develop autoimmune diseases</a>, and there are numerous <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri.2016.90">differences in women’s immune systems</a> compared to men. Like most diseases disproportionately impacting women or people of colour, autoimmune diseases have too often been neglected when it comes to funding and research, leaving a rudimentary understanding, inadequate treatments, and lots of open questions.</p>
<p>Moreover, autoimmune diseases have often been treated in different silos, based on which body system they impact. Crohn’s disease is studied by gastroenterologists, psoriasis by dermatologists, and Hashimoto’s by endocrinologists. While there are reasons for this approach, it can also hinder research on deeper patterns amongst autoimmune disorders. Once someone develops one autoimmune disease, they are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150011/">significantly more likely</a> to develop additional ones, which is another reason why studying common underlying causes and mechanisms would be helpful.</p>
<p>Autoimmune disorders are often treated with medications that suppress the immune system to keep it from attacking the patient’s own body. While these medications can be crucial in addressing symptoms, they come with the significant downside of inhibiting how the immune system responds to foreign invaders, making the patient vulnerable to infection.</p>
</section>
<section id="viruses-can-cause-neurodegenerative-diseases-too" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="viruses-can-cause-neurodegenerative-diseases-too">Viruses can cause neurodegenerative diseases too</h2>
<p>Diseases that cause cells in the brain or nervous system to lose function and eventually die are referred to as neurodegenerative diseases. Some are also autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis is perhaps the best known disease that is firmly established as both neurodegenerative and autoimmune. In this disease, the immune system attacks the protective sheaths coating nervous cells in the spinal cord and brain. Evidence is growing that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31507117/">ALS</a> (also known as Lou Gerig’s disease), <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33131704/">Parkinson’s disease</a> have autoimmune causes, and some researchers are asking if <a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12789">Alzheimer’s</a> is an autoimmune disease too.</p>
<p>Common viruses increase the risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease, for up to 15 years after the viral infection. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36669485/">study drawing on datasets of 800,000 people</a> across Finland and the UK looked at how various viruses could increase likelihood of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, ALS, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and dementia, and found many significant links. For instance, six different groups of viruses (including flu and viral pneumonia) were linked to an increased risk of developing dementia. Viral encephalitis (a virus which in many cases causes only mild, flu-like symptoms) raised the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. These were just a few of the associations found.</p>

</div>
<p>For decades, research on Alzheimer’s Disease was dominated by a hypothesis that mostly turned out to be a dead-end. Funding and support was funnelled toward projects that failed (and in some cases, were based on fraudulent data), while other researchers (whose ideas are now being proven correct) <a href="https://theconversation.com/my-work-investigating-the-links-between-viruses-and-alzheimers-disease-was-dismissed-for-years-but-now-the-evidence-is-building-184201">faced hostility and extreme difficulty</a> obtaining grants. For decades, the idea of viruses being a cause of Alzheimer’s was considered absurd, with only a few lone researchers pursuing it in the face of pushback and ostracism, yet now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/19/could-alzheimers-be-caused-by-an-infection">ever more research</a> is accumulating to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8234998/">support this idea</a>.</p>
<p>A core idea in Alzheimer’s research has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30314800/">turned out to be backwards</a>: what was considered to be an intrinsically abnormal and useless protein (amyloid-beta) causing Alzheimer’s has turned out to be a part of our innate immune response, intended to protect the brain against infection. Amyloid-beta may be inadvertently causing harm, but it likely builds up as a protective reaction against a more fundamental root cause. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29504537/">Amyloid-beta has positive, anti-microbial properties</a> for fighting off invaders. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29488144/">large study from Taiwan</a> found that HSV-1 infections increased the risk of developing dementia, but that treating these infections with antiviral medication lowered that risk.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="science-is-political">Science is political</h2>
<p>There have been many hurdles to pursuing the role of infection in contributing to Alzheimer’s: the siloed nature of science (virology and Alzheimer’s were seen as two very disparate areas); the failure of many to understand asymptomatic infection; and the political nature of medicine.</p>
<p>Science does not just progress inevitably. Instead, <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2021-10-12-medicine-political/">politics, biases, and even trends</a> all impact which ideas receive the opportunities, funding, and support for progress to be made. A reluctance over decades to adequately fund post-viral research, to explore links between viruses and neurodegenerative diseases, or to take autoimmune diseases (which disproportionately impact women) seriously, has left us knowing far less than we could. Treating autoimmune diseases all in separate silos has limited progress, as has treating neurodegenerative diseases siloed away from virology.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2021-10-12-medicine-political/">previous essay</a>, I wrote of the political nature of medicine, including several key case studies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serious political battles and protests were needed to get AIDS taken seriously.</li>
<li>An ongoing lack of funding for ME/CFS research, spanning decades, even though ME/CFS patients have the lowest quality of life of pretty much any illness. Commensurate to disease burden, NIH funding for ME/CFS is at only 7%, depression and asthma are at 100%, and diseases like cancer and HIV are closer to 1000%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our understanding of the wide-ranging, surprising, and sometimes devastating impacts of viruses is growing everyday, with new scientific discoveries and connections being made. If we can accelerate support for such research, as well as work to reduce transmission of viruses, we could significantly improve human well-being.</p>

<p>When I was 6, I caught chickenpox (this was before the chickenpox vaccine was widely available). I found the blisters quite itchy and painful, and I insisted that my parents take a picture of me so I could have a record of how many blisters I had. I stayed home from school for 2 weeks and was quite disappointed to miss being in the Amelia Bedelia school play (Amelia Bedelia was the protagonist of my favourite book series at the time, about a maid who takes everything literally). The only upside was getting to watch a VHS tape of the Pippi Longstocking movie on repeat. Once I recovered, I thought of chickenpox as annoying and unpleasant, but not a big deal in the scheme of things.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="long-term-impacts-of-the-virus-behind-chickenpox">Long-term impacts of the virus behind chickenpox</h2>
<p>Only much later did I learn that chickenpox is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which remains latent in our neurons after infection, and for 30% of people, unless vaccinated, will reactivate as shingles decades later. People who have shingles are at an <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35025605/">80% higher risk of stroke</a> for up to a year afterwards, long after the acute symptoms of shingles have gone away. The stroke risk is particularly high for people who get shingles under the age of 40 (and this younger group is not eligible for the shingles vaccine).</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which VZV leads to this increased stroke risk are still being actively researched. In 2022, researchers discovered that <a href="https://theconversation.com/chickenpox-and-shingles-virus-lying-dormant-in-your-neurons-can-reactivate-and-increase-your-risk-of-stroke-new-research-identified-a-potential-culprit-194627">VZV causes the formation of small sacs full of proteins which promote blood clots</a>. (These small sacs are called exosomes and are used to transport various materials through our bloodstream.) These blood-clot-encouraging exosomes are still being produced 3 months after a shingles infection, and likely for longer (the study ended at 3 months).</p>

</div>
<p>VZV is not just linked to strokes, but also linked to developing multiple sclerosis or vascular dementia, as was found in a <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)01147-3">recent study analysing</a> hundreds of thousands of medical records for associations between common viruses and diseases impacting the brain and nervous system. In the case of VZV, it is possible that the links to dementia and MS may occur through the reactivation of other viruses. That is another disturbing fact about viruses: they can quietly lie latent for years and then be reactivated by other viruses.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-arent-infections-inevitable">But aren’t infections inevitable?</h2>
<p>I never gave much thought to how my brother and I had caught chicken pox, because for most of my life I assumed that viruses were a temporary discomfort, and that they were generally inevitable, just something that happens. However, in recent years, medical understanding of how pathogens spread has been upended, which in turn has profound implications for what we can do in response.</p>
<p>The flu, long believed to be spread through droplets from sneezes or through touching contaminated surfaces, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1716561115">has been shown</a> to be released in small aerosols exhaled through ordinary breathing. These aerosols can remain suspended in the air, and others risk infection when they breathe them in. In work published in the prestigious PNAS, researchers found that neither sneezing nor coughing was necessary to spread flu, just ordinary breathing. This shift in understanding is important: it means that we have been relying on insufficient tools to stop viruses (e.g.&nbsp;hand washing and poorly fitting surgical masks alone will never be enough against airborne flu). Chickenpox, too, is spread through the air. As Professor Jonathan Gershoni of Tel Aviv University says in <a href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:IsraelX+Virus101x+2T2018/home">his course on viruses</a>, “<em>The most common direct route [of viral transmission] is when viruses become airborne and are subsequently inhaled. When people cough, sneeze, or simply exhale, they produce an aerosol of minute fluid droplets that are dispersed in the air around them.</em>”</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are ways we can clean the air with improved ventilation (drawing in more outdoor air), filtration (removing harmful particles), and well-fitting masks in crowded public indoor spaces. For years, excellent ventilation and filtration systems have been used in pig farms, to avoid the spread of airborne porcine diseases, with some farms even <a href="https://twitter.com/LongDesertTrain/status/1494126639608909826?s=20">employing a worker whose sole duty</a> is the daily inspection and maintenance of the ventilation/filtration systems. Numerous studies document the effectiveness of hog farm filtration systems at reducing illness (see <a href="https://twitter.com/LongDesertTrain/status/1494126572625924098?s=20">this fascinating thread</a> for links), as well as the harms of poor ventilation for humans. Methods to clean the air have been implemented by wealthy elites at places including the <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/01/davos-covid-precaution-uv-lights-air-filters.html">World Economic Forum’s Davos Summit</a> (attended by politicians and billionaires), the <a href="https://www.purifiedair.com/case-studies/hm-government/">UK Parliament</a>, <a href="https://www.purifiedair.com/case-studies/palace-of-westminster/">Westminster Palace</a>, and an <a href="https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/tp/files/81592/Document%20-%20COVIDSafe%20plan%20-%20Sittings%2014%20%E2%80%93%2025%20February%202022%20%E2%80%93%20dated%2011%20February%202022.PDF">Australian state parliament</a>. However, unlike politicians and pigs, very few children or working class people have access to clean air in their schools or workplaces.</p>
<p>Rice University biochemistry and cell biology professor Alma Moon Novotny opened her <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/immunology#courses">series of in-depth immunology courses</a> by singing the praises of not immunologists nor virologists, but of… engineers! Prof Novotny said, “<em>I want to emphasize that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I will be praising engineers, particularly civil engineers because what they provide for us is clean water and proper sewage disposal.</em>” She suggested that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jan/19/health.medicineandhealth3">sanitation is the greatest medical advance of the last 150 years</a> and went on to list other important engineering improvements that improve health: mosquito nets, houses that don’t let in as many insects (which can often carry pathogens), and an infrastructure system to transport needed medical supplies. She also spoke of how expensive our immune systems are in terms of ATP (our bodies’ energy currency). Despite the amazing intricacies of the human immune system, it is better to avoid getting sick.</p>

<p>Experts have been highlighting the extensive infrastructure overhaul London used to tackle cholera in the 19th century, similar to how cleaning indoor air could be part of a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/09/coronavirus-pandemic-ventilation-rethinking-air/620000/">“plan to stop every respiratory virus at once”</a>.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-new-way-of-thinking">A New Way of Thinking</h2>
<p>The idea that a common childhood virus can quietly hang out unnoticed in our nervous system for decades, reactivate to cause the blisters and nerve pain of shingles, and then months after the shingles blisters clear up cause blood clotting and strokes is mind-boggling to me, and stands in stark contrast to how I thought about viruses when I was younger.</p>
<p>The trajectory of my growing understanding of VZV is similar to my understanding of many viruses: I have moved from thinking of common viruses as both inevitable and discretely contained events (e.g.&nbsp;you are sick for a week or two, but then it’s over) to recognizing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>even common viruses can have long-reaching, surprising, and devastating consequences</li>
<li>there is much more we can do to stop viral transmission than I previously realised</li>
</ul>
<p>VZV is just one of many viruses that have surprised me. Research has now shown that several <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)01147-3">common viruses raise the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease</a>, and the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35025605/">virus behind mono / glandular fever (Epstein-Barr virus) causes Multiple Sclerosis</a>. The fact that it is possible to reduce viral transmission makes it all the more urgent to understand the long-reaching consequences of viruses, since we have the power to act on what we learn.</p>
<p>Each risk on its own may not be that likely on the individual level: I am not suggesting that you should feel alarmed that you in particular will suffer a stroke after shingles, or that your elderly parent will catch the flu and then develop dementia, or that mono/glandular fever will lead to multiple sclerosis for you. However, it is important to think about this across the population, and across all these different virus-disease interactions. When you look at this research in aggregate, it suggests that many, many people are having their lives drastically impacted by diseases in which viruses play a role. Given what we know about both the risks of viruses and ways to reduce transmission, it is worthwhile to take effective measures like <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg2025">increasing ventilation</a>, using <a href="https://theconversation.com/we-studied-how-to-reduce-airborne-covid-spread-in-hospitals-heres-what-we-learnt-166018">air purifiers</a>, and wearing <a href="https://theconversation.com/time-to-upgrade-from-cloth-and-surgical-masks-to-respirators-your-questions-answered-174877">N95/KF94/P2 masks in indoor public places</a> to make our schools, workplaces, and healthcare settings safer.</p>

<section id="anki-is-a-learning-superpower" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="anki-is-a-learning-superpower">Anki is a learning superpower</h2>
<p>I have been using Anki flashcards to help me study. Anki is a free, open-source system based on the research of spaced repetition learning. I have been using this technique to study immunology, but it can be used for any subject. You make your own cards and they can include anything you like. Anki is an app available on Android, iPhone, and desktop, and it is easy to sync between your phone and computer (it is free on Android and desktop, although costs money for the iPhone). I want to explain the basics of the approach. This post is intended for people new to Anki– I will not cover power user features.</p>

</div>
<p>Over 6 months ago, <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2023-02-07-school-immunology/">I began studying immunology</a> every day. Every immunology professor I’ve watched lectures from has said that learning immunology is like learning a foreign language and that the amount of specialised jargon is intense. At first, I pulled out a notebook to write down what I wanted to remember. However, I soon decided to try out Anki flashcards instead.</p>
</section>
<section id="spaced-repetition-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spaced-repetition-learning">Spaced Repetition Learning</h2>
<p>In order to retain information, research shows that the best time to be quizzed about something you are learning is right before you otherwise would have forgotten it. For new information, this will be relatively soon. However, as you study a piece of information more times, you can go longer and longer before you need to be prompted about it. The other key factor in when you need to see a card again is how difficult a question is for you. If you find it easy, you can wait longer before you need to see it again, but if it’s hard, you should review it sooner. And if you got it wrong or didn’t know the answer, you should study it again in the same session. Anki handles the spacing of cards for you, keeping track of when you need to see each card again.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">My practice using Anki for the last 28 weeks (darker blue means more cards studied)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>You create the cards. You can write with text, include images, and/or use a fill-in-the-blank format (called cloze). I usually make flashcards as I watch video lectures, pausing the video to screenshot images I want to use or to transcribe key points I want to remember. I make cards on my laptop as I watch videos and then study on my phone.</p>
</section>
<section id="again-hard-good-easy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="again-hard-good-easy">Again, Hard, Good, Easy</h2>
<p>On the back of each card, at the bottom, Anki offers you 4 choices to rate whether you need to see the card again (choose this if you got it wrong) or whether you found it hard, good, or easy. For a new card, all the choices will lead to reviewing again soon, with “easy” corresponding to 4 days. However, over time, the choices for all options get longer as you answer the card correctly more times (except for “again”, which indicates you forgot and need to restart that card). This shows the options Anki gives on 3 different cards: a brand new one, one I’ve seen a few times, and one I’ve gotten correct many times (and likely won’t need to see again for many months).</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">The lengths of time vary based on your history with the card</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If you get a card wrong/need to see it again, Anki will reset to showing you the card with higher frequency again. Here is an old card that I missed. After I select “Again” (because I forgot an answer), these were the options the next time I see that card:</p>

</section>
<section id="sustainable-over-time" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sustainable-over-time">Sustainable over time</h2>
<p>Since you will see older cards less and less often (assuming you are getting them mostly correct), the number of Anki cards you need to do each day will decline with time if you don’t add more cards. This makes Anki feel very sustainable to pick up, and I have found a rhythm around how many new cards I can add each day, while keeping the time I spend on Anki relatively constant. <strong>It is reassuring to know that as long as I keep up on my daily cards, I will be able to retain the information I am learning.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, I can look at my stats on Anki and see that today I did 114 cards, but for each day going forward I will have less and less (this graph doesn’t take into account that I plan to continue adding new cards each day).</p>

<p>My daughter is currently taking <a href="https://biochemistryliteracyforkids.com/">Biochemistry Literacy for Kids</a>, a biochem course aimed at elementary aged children. The teacher suggested that the kids should memorise the 20 basic amino acids. While my daughter was initially unsure if she’d be able to do it, she had fun making up silly stories about each one (based on their structure and name), only spends a few minutes on Anki each day, and now has a strong sense of pride that she knows the amino acids (and her parents don’t).</p>
<p>My partner Jeremy used Anki <a href="https://vimeo.com/40265872">to study Chinese characters</a>. After 6 months of study, when he went to Beijing to attend an in-person Chinese school, he tested into a class where the other students had years of practice.</p>

  <title>I was an AI researcher. Now, I am an immunology student.</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I like complexity, and I like challenges. When a new topic fascinates me, I want to devote all of my time to it. In 2012, I was working as a quant in energy trading when I became so captivated by the topic of machine learning that I abruptly moved cross-country to San Francisco and spent a decade learning as much as I could about machine learning, AI, data ethics, and algorithmic harms. In 2022, I became fascinated by a new topic: immunology. I completed 7 online courses last year, am currently taking 4 more courses, and have created over 2,000 immunology-related flashcards for myself, which I spend time on daily. (I will write more about how I use Anki flashcards in a future post.)</p>
<p>I found immunology to be both overwhelming and fascinating. The field is full of jargon, and there is a steep curve just to learn the language: IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18, CD-3, CD-22, CD-34, CD-47, CD-155, C3, C5, C8, and so on (lots of letter/number combinations, abbreviations, and acronyms! But underneath them, the mechanisms are fascinating). The more I studied, the more I wanted to learn. It became clear that I needed a formal program to go deeper and to provide appropriate context, so I started applying to graduate school.</p>

<p>I was delighted to be accepted to a Masters in Immunology graduate program, and after eager anticipation, last month I officially began my formal degree. While my ultimate goal is to apply my machine learning and data ethics expertise to the field, I want to make sure I fully understand the relevant immunology first. Too often machine learning practitioners unthinkingly grasp for a nail to use their hammer on, without first having the necessary in-depth knowledge of the underlying domain, its data, its context, and its actual challenges.</p>
<p>The more I learn about immunology, the more I realise how complex, vast, and full of open questions and not-yet-understood phenomena the field is. It was only in 2021 that researchers proved <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222">Epstein-Barr virus causes multiple sclerosis</a>. Researchers are making new discoveries about <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)01147-3">links between viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases</a>, such as Alzheimer’s. A study in late 2022 found a possible mechanism to explain the fact that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiac405/6749009">varicella zoster virus significantly increases risk of stroke</a>. Unusually severe outbreaks of RSV and Group A Strep (a bacteria that can often follow as a secondary infection after a virus) made headlines in the past few months. A variety of viruses have long been known to sometimes trigger autoimmune diseases or cancer, yet there is still much to discover about these relationships.</p>

<p>For over 20 years, my focus has been on mathematics, computer science, and data ethics. I studied mathematics, computer science, and linguistics as an undergraduate; earned a PhD in mathematics; and then spent 12 years working in a mix of industry and academia as a data scientist, teacher, and researcher. I am best known for my work as cofounder of fast.ai, creator of the most popular deep learning courses in the world, and for previously serving as the founding director of the University of San Francisco Center for Applied Data Ethics. Over the years, I have had a recurring interest in medicine, doing mathematical modelling of cell processes as part of a Howard Hughes Medical Institute fellowship while I was in graduate school, publishing about <a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/rachel-thomas-medicines-machine-learning-problem">machine learning in medicine</a> for The Boston Review, and being an invited keynote speaker for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVRWeGlMkGk&amp;list=PLtmWHNX-gukLQlMvtRJ19s7-8MrnRV6h6&amp;index=3">Stanford’s AI in Medicine</a> symposium.</p>

<p>Core to the mission of fast.ai is the idea that domain expertise is crucial. In our very first post <a href="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2016-10-07-fastai-launch.html">announcing the launch of fast.ai</a> in 2016, my cofounder Jeremy Howard wrote, <em>“Only domain experts: fully understand and appreciate what are the most important problems in their field; have access to the data necessary to solve those problems; and understand the opportunities and constraints to implementing data driven solutions.”</em> It is dangerous for machine learning practitioners to apply machine learning to fields in which they have only superficial knowledge (unless working closely with domain experts from end-to-end). Collaborative, interdisciplinary, and career changing work has always fascinated me. I have written about how <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2022-06-01-qualitative/">necessary qualitative humanities research</a> is to the field of AI. I previously taught software engineering to adult women changing careers, and long-believed that career changers have something special to offer. I am now taking my own advice, and delving into immunology, <strong>with the long-term goal of integrating this new knowledge with my data ethics and machine learning skills.</strong></p>

<p>After having been in a more “established” place in my career for a while, it is intimidating to publicly start off on a new branch like this. However, it’s also exciting, and I hope to share some of my journey as an immunology student along the way through blog posts and essays, just as <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2019-05-13-blogging-advice/">I’ve always encouraged fast.ai students</a> to do.</p>

  <title>My family’s unlikely homeschooling journey</title>
  <dc:creator>Rachel Thomas</dc:creator>
  <link>https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2022-09-06-homeschooling/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>My husband Jeremy and I never intended to homeschool, and yet we have now, unexpectedly, committed to homeschooling long-term. Prior to the pandemic, we both worked full-time in careers that we loved and found meaningful, and we sent our daughter to a full-day Montessori school. Although I struggled with significant health issues, I felt unbelievably lucky and fulfilled in both my family life and my professional life. The pandemic upended my careful balance. Every family is different, with different needs, circumstances, and constraints, and what works for one may not work for others. My intention here is primarily to share the journey of my own (very privileged) family.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-unplanned-introduction-to-homeschooling">Our unplanned introduction to homeschooling</h2>
<p>For the first year of the pandemic, most schools in California, where we lived at the time, were closed. Like countless other families, we were unexpectedly thrust into the world of virtual-school and home-school. We ended up participating in an <a href="https://www.modulo.app/">innovative online program</a> that did NOT try to replicate in-person school. A few key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each child could <strong>work at their own pace</strong>, largely through playing educational games and apps that adapted to where they were. There was no particular endpoint that the kids needed to get to at the end of the semester.</li>
<li>Group video calls were <strong>limited in size</strong> to no more than 6 kids (and often smaller), so kids got lots of personal interaction with their tutors and each other. Even as an adult, I find video calls larger than 6 people overwhelming.</li>
<li><strong>Regular movement breaks</strong>, where the kids had jumping jack competitions, did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CosmicKidsYoga">Cosmic Kids yoga videos</a>, held dance parties, and ran around the house for scavenger hunts.</li>
<li><strong>Took advantage of existing materials</strong>: the program did not reinvent the wheel, but instead made use of excellent, existing online videos and educational apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>From August 2020 - March 2021, our daughter was with a small group online, where daily she would spend 1 hour on socio-emotional development (including games, getting to know each other, and discussing feelings), 1 hour on reading, and 1 hour on math. For reading and math, the children each worked at their own pace through engaging games, and could ask the teacher and each other questions whenever they needed help. At the end of these 8 months, our daughter, along with several other kids in her small group, were several years beyond their age levels in both math and reading. It had never been our goal for her to end up accelerated; Jeremy and I were mostly trying to keep her happy and busy for a few hours so we could get some of our own work done. She also had fun and made close friends, who she continues to have video calls and Minecraft virtual playdates with regularly.</p>

<section id="our-unconventional-views" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-unconventional-views">Our unconventional views</h2>
<p>Although there are plenty of ways to homeschool that don’t involve any screens or technology, Jeremy and I have made use of online tutors, long-distance friendships, educational apps, videos, and web-based games, as key parts of our approach. One thing that helped us going into the pandemic is that we have never treated online/long-distance relationships as inferior to in-person relationships. We both have meaningful friendships that occur primarily, or even entirely, through phone calls, video chats, texts, and online interactions. I have made several big moves since I graduated from high school (moving from Texas to Pennsylvania to North Carolina back to Pennsylvania again and then to California) and I was used to family and close friends being long distance. We live far from our families, and our daughter was already accustomed to chatting with her grandparents on both sides via video calls. My daughter’s best friend is now a child she has never met in person, but has been skyping with almost daily for the last 2 years.</p>
<p>Another thing that made this transition easier is that Jeremy and I have never been anti-screen time. In fact, we don’t consider “screen time” a useful category, since a child passively watching a movie alone is different than skyping with their grandparent is different than playing an educational game interactively with their parent beside them. While we almost never let our daughter do things passively and alone with screens, we enjoy relational and educational screen time. Furthermore, we focus on including other positive life elements (e.g.&nbsp;making sure she is getting enough time outside, being physically active, reading, getting enough sleep, etc) rather than emphasising limits.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-return-to-in-person-school">A return to in-person school</h2>
<p>In 2021, our family immigrated from the USA to my husband’s home country of Australia, and we enrolled our daughter at an in-person school, which she attended from late April - early Dec 2021. Our state had closed borders and almost no cases of covid transmission during this time. By all measures, the school she attended is great: friendly families, kind staff, and a fun performing arts program. While our daughter adjusted quickly to the new environment and made friends, she was quite bored. She lost her previous curiosity and enthusiasm, became more passive, and started to spend a lot of time zoning out. The school tried to accommodate her, letting her join an older grade level for math each day. While the material was initially new, she still found the pace too slow. She started to get very upset at home practising piano or playing chess (activities she previously loved, but where mistakes are inevitable), because she had grown accustomed to getting everything right without trying. At one point, all schools in our region closed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/07/31/world/covid-delta-variant-vaccine/brisbane-australias-third-largest-city-joins-sydney-in-lockdown">during an 8-day snap lockdown.</a> Our daughter was disappointed when the lockdown ended and she had to return to school.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-homeschooling-works-well-and-when-it-doesnt">When homeschooling works well (and when it doesn’t)</h2>
<p>Over the summer holidays (Dec 2021-Jan 2022), our state pivoted from zero covid to <a href="https://medium.com/@ColinKinner/lethal-stupidity-how-the-palaszczuk-governments-covid-response-has-thrown-queenslanders-under-52a127d67724">promoting mass infection as “necessary”</a>. We pulled our daughter out of school, initially intending that it would just be a temporary measure until her age group could be fully vaccinated (vaccine rollout was later in Australia than in the USA). However, we immediately saw positive changes, with her regaining her old curiosity, enthusiasm, and proactive nature, all of which she had lost being in school. Her perfectionism disappeared and she began to enjoy challenges again. We supplemented her online classes with in-person playdates, extracurriculars, and sports (due to covid risks, we wear masks and stay outdoors for all of these). We are fortunate to live in a beautiful part of the world, where we can spend most of the year outside. We enjoy visiting the beaches, forests, and parks in our region. Our daughter is happy: playing Minecraft with friends online, learning tennis with other local children, riding bikes as a family, spending hours absorbed in books of her own choosing, enjoying piano and chess again, running around in nature, and learning at her own pace.</p>
<p>Homeschooled kids typically score <a href="https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/">15 to 30 percentile points</a> above public-school students on standardised academic achievement tests, and <a href="https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/">87% of studies on social development</a> “showed clearly positive outcomes for the homeschooled compared to those in conventional schools”. However, it is understandable that many children had negative experiences with virtual learning in the past 2 years, given that programs were often hastily thrown together with inadequate resources and inappropriately structured to try to mimic in-person school, against the stressful backdrop of a global pandemic. Many parents faced the impossible task of simultaneously needing to work full-time and help their children full-time (and many other parents did not even have the option to stay home). Every family is different, and virtual learning or homeschooling will not suit everyone. There are children who need in-person services only offered within schools; parents whose work constraints don’t allow for it; and kids who thrive being with tons of other kids.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty of the pandemic, there are a variety of families who found that virtual or homeschooling was better for their particular kids. Some parents have shared about children with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/opinion/coronavirus-school-closures.html">ADHD who found in-person school too distracting; children who were facing bullying or violence at school; kids who couldn’t get enough sleep on a traditional school schedule</a>; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pandemic-homeschoolers-who-are-not-going-back/">Black and Latino families whose cultural heritages were not being reflected in curriculums</a>. I enjoyed these article featuring a few such families:</p>

<section id="covid-risks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="covid-risks">Covid Risks</h2>
<p>I have had brain surgery twice, was hospitalised in the ICU with a life-threatening brain infection, and have a number of chronic health issues. I am both at higher risk for negative outcomes from covid AND acutely aware of how losing your health can destroy your life. It is lonely and difficult being high-risk in a society that has given up on protecting others. While I am nervous about the long-term impact that homeschooling will have on my career (on top of how <a href="https://medium.com/@racheltho/techs-long-hours-are-discriminatory-and-counterproductive-3676e649a601">my existing health issues already hinder it</a>), acquiring additional disabilities would be far, far worse.</p>
<p>I have been disturbed to follow the ever-accumulating research on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00403-0">cardiovascular</a>, <a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/research-suggests-covid-affects-brain-even-in-mild">neurological</a>, and <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-021-02228-6">immune system</a> harms that can be caused by covid, even in <a href="https://missoulian.com/news/local/missed-risk-long-covid-threat-extends-far-beyond-pandemic/article_70311453-1f78-5068-b1ea-02886b41741a.html#tracking-source=most-popular-homepage">previously healthy people</a>, even in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01453-0">the vaccinated</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/08/04/covid-creates-higher-risk-kids-children-pediatric-blood-clots-kidney-failure-heart-problems-type-1-diabetes/">even in children</a>. While vaccines significantly reduce risk of death, unfortunately they provide <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01453-0">only a limited reduction in Long Covid risk</a>. Immunity wanes, and people face <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-24/reinfection-covid-more-severe-new-variants/101178246">cumulative risks with each new covid infection</a> (so even if you’ve had covid once or twice, it is best to try to avoid reinfections). I am alarmed that <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinKinner/status/1557257474235076608?s=20&amp;t=hjlgmHIe24111OVNRCDk_Q">leaders are encouraging</a> mass, repeated infections of a generation of children.</p>
<p>Given all this, I am relieved that our decision to continue homeschooling was relatively clear. It much better suits our daughter’s needs AND drastically reduces our family’s covid risk. We can nurture her innate curiosity, protect her intrinsic motivation, and provide in-person social options that are entirely outdoors and safer than being indoors all day at school. Most families are not so fortunate and many face difficult choices, with no good options.</p>

<section id="the-broader-picture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-broader-picture">The Broader Picture</h2>
<p>I believe that high-quality, equitable, and safe public education is important for a healthy democracy, and I worry about the various ongoing ways in which education is being undermined and attacked. Furthermore, due to a lack of covid protections in communities, high-risk children and children with high-risk families are being shut out of in-person school options in the USA, Australia, and many other places. While the <a href="https://twitter.com/math_rachel/status/1464827214298443780?s=20&amp;t=sRWCS-xGf3G57R4LVWcDdQ">workplaces of politicians</a> and a handful of <a href="https://twitter.com/myrabatchelder/status/1485870339368366083?s=20&amp;t=sRWCS-xGf3G57R4LVWcDdQ">schools in ultra-wealthy areas</a> installed expensive ventilation upgrades, the majority of schools in the USA and Australia have not had any ventilation upgrades, nor received air purifiers. All children deserve access to an education that is safe, fits their needs, and will allow them to thrive. Even when homeschooling does work, it is often still just an individual solution to systemic problems.</p>

<em>“All research is qualitative; some is also quantitative”</em> <br>– Harvard Social Scientist and Statistician Gary King
</center>
<p><br> Suppose you wanted to find out whether a machine learning system being adopted - to <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/05/all-the-ways-hiring-algorithms-can-introduce-bias">recruit candidates</a>, <a href="https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/research/blog/black-loans-matter-fighting-bias-for-ai-fairness-in-lending/">lend money</a>, or <a href="https://www.propublica.org/podcast/how-we-decided-to-test-racial-bias-in-algorithms">predict future criminality</a> - exhibited racial bias. You might calculate model performance across groups with different races. But <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3372826">how was race categorised</a>– through a census record, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s24vksJRJeE&amp;list=PLgdVmcMc8gy4sVLlgM0GUnnVZ1Fu0et05&amp;index=6">police officer’s guess</a>, or by an annotator? Each possible answer raises another set of questions. Following the thread of any seemingly quantitative issue around AI ethics quickly leads to a host of qualitative questions. Throughout AI, qualitative decisions are made about what metrics to optimise for, which categories to use, how to define their bounds, who applies the labels. Similarly, qualitative research is necessary to understand AI systems operating in society: evaluating system performance beyond what can be captured in short term metrics, understanding what is missed by large-scale studies (which can elide details and overlook outliers), and shedding light on the circumstances in which data is produced (often by crowd-sourced or poorly paid workers).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is often a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951719833404">large divide between</a> computer scientists and social scientists, with over-simplified assumptions and fundamental misunderstandings of one another. Even when cross-disciplinary partnerships occur, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951719833404">they often fall</a> into “normal disciplinary divisions of labour: social scientists observe, data scientists make; social scientists do ethics, data scientists do science; social scientists do the incalculable, data scientists do the calculable.” The solution is not for computer scientists to absorb a shallow understanding of the social sciences, but for deeper collaborations. In a paper on <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445914">exclusionary practices in AI ethics</a>, an interdisciplinary team wrote of the “indifference, devaluation, and lack of mutual support between CS and humanistic social science (HSS), [which elevates] the myth of technologists as ‘ethical unicorns’ that can do it all, though their disciplinary tools are ultimately limited.”</p>

<p>This is further reflected in an increasing number of <a href="https://twitter.com/cfiesler/status/1427341587613376514?s=20&amp;t=_5Ud6jmEELMulK5LSha9gA">job ads</a> for AI ethicists that list a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-ethics-jobs-catherine-hicks-algorithms">computer science degree as a requirement</a>, “prioritising technical computer science infrastructure over the social science skills that can evaluate AI’s social impact. In doing so, we are building the field of AI Ethics to replicate the very flaws this field is trying to fix.” <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12358">Interviews with 26 responsible AI practitioners</a> working in industry highlighted a number of challenges, including that qualitative work was not prioritised. Not only is it impossible to fully understand ethics issues solely through quantitative metrics, inappropriate and misleading quantitative metrics are used to evaluate the responsible AI practitioners themselves. Interviewees reported that their fairness work was evaluated on metrics related to generating revenue, in a stark misalignment of goals.</p>

<p>When companies like Google and YouTube want to test whether the recommendations they are making (in the form of search engine results or YouTube videos, for example) are “good” - they will often focus quite heavily on “engagement” or “dwell time” - the time a user spent looking at or watching the item recommended to them. But it turns out, unsurprisingly, that a focus on engagement and dwell time, narrowly understood, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12358">raises all sorts of problems</a>. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3041021.3054197?casa_token=BxsZ44gFqdQAAAAA:uMs35O3Qn8oFsHM8LBYo2XJ5jnQGPD4L2NWhxa7iVa5MMwovG-zd3hoEixb9F5_up1LM0kNSG9Krew">Demographics can impact dwell time</a> (e.g.&nbsp;older users may spend longer on websites than younger users, just as part of the way they use the internet). A system that ‘learns’ from a user’s behavioural cues (rather than their ‘stated preferences’) might lock them into a limiting feedback loop, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2959100.2959179">appealing to that user’s short term interests rather than those of their ‘Better Selves.’</a> Scholars have called for <a href="https://datascience.columbia.edu/news/2018/ethical-principles-okrs-and-kpis-what-youtube-and-facebook-could-learn-from-tukey/">more qualitative research</a> to understand user experience and build this into <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(22)00056-3">the development of metrics</a>.</p>
<p>This is the part where people will point out, rightly, that companies like Google and YouTube rely on a complex range of metrics and signals in their machine learning systems - and that where a website ranks on Google, or how a YouTube video performs in recommendation does not boil down to simple popularity metrics, like engagement. Google employs an extensive process to determine <a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/users/">“relevance” and “usefulness” for search results</a>. In its <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9281931?hl=en">172-page manual for search result ‘Quality’ evaluation</a>, for example, the company explains how evaluators should assess a website’s ‘Expertise/ Authoritativeness/ Trustworthiness’ or ‘E-A-T’; and what types of content, by virtue of its harmful nature (e.g., to protected groups), should be given a ‘low’ ranking. YouTube has identified specific categories of content (such as news, scientific subjects, and historical information) for which ‘authoritativeness’ should be considered especially important. It has also determined that dubious-but-not-quite-rule-breaking information (what it calls ‘borderline content’) should not be recommended, <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/the-four-rs-of-responsibility-raise-and-reduce/">regardless of the video’s engagement levels</a>.</p>
<p>Irrespective of how successful we consider the existing approaches of Google Search and YouTube to be (and partly, the issue is that evaluating their implementation from the outside is frustratingly difficult), the point here is that there are constant qualitative judgments being made, about what makes a search result or recommendation “good” and of how to define and quantify expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness, borderline content, and other values. This is true of all machine learning evaluation, even when it isn’t explicit. In a paper guiding companies about <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3372873">how to carry out internal audits of their AI systems</a>, Inioluwa Deborah Raji and colleagues emphasise the importance of interviews with management and engineering teams to “capture and pay attention to what falls outside the measurements and metrics, and to render explicit the assumptions and values the metrics apprehend.” (p.40).</p>
<p>The importance of thoughtful humanities research is heightened if we are serious about grappling with the potential broader social effects of machine learning systems (both good and bad), which are often <a href="https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/beyond-individual-governing-ais-societal-harm">delayed, distributed and cumulative</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="small-scale-qualitative-studies-tell-an-important-story">Small-scale qualitative studies tell an important story</h2>
<p>Hypothetically, let’s say you wanted to find out whether the use of AI technologies by doctors during a medical appointment would make doctors less attentive to patients - what do you think the best way of doing it would be? You could find some criteria and method for measuring ‘attentiveness’, say tracking the amount of eye contact between the doctor and patient, and analyse this across a representative sample of medical appointments where AI technologies were being used, compared to a control group of medical appointments where AI technologies weren’t being used. Or would you interview doctors about their experiences using the technology during appointments? Or talk to patients about how they felt the technology did, or didn’t, impact their experience?</p>
<p>In research circles, we describe these as ‘epistemological’ choices - your judgement of what constitutes the ‘best’ approach is inextricably linked to your judgement about <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-do-you-know-that-what-you-know-is-true-thats-epistemology-63884"><em>how</em> we can claim to ‘know’ something</a>. These are all valid methods for approaching the question, but you can imagine how they might result in different, even conflicting, insights. For example, you might end up with the following results: - The eye contact tracking experiment suggests that overall, there is no significant difference in doctors’ attentiveness to the patient when the AI tech is introduced. - The interviews with doctors and patients reveal that some doctors and patients feel that the AI technology reduces doctors’ attentiveness to patients, and others feel that it makes no difference or even increases doctors’ attention to the patient.</p>
<p>Even if people are not negatively impacted by something ‘on average’ (e.g., in our hypothetical eye contact tracking experiment above), there will remain groups of people who will experience negative impacts, perhaps acutely so. “Many of people’s most pressing questions are about effects that vary for different people,” write Matias, Pennington and Chan in a recent paper on the <a href="https://osf.io/tn6x4/">idea of N-of-one trials</a>. To tell people that their experiences aren’t real or valid because they don’t meet some threshold for statistical significance across a large population doesn’t help us account for the breadth and nature of AI’s impacts on the world.</p>
<p>Examples of this tension between competing claims to knowledge about AI systems’ impacts abound. Influencers who believe they are being systematically downranked (‘shadowbanned’) by Instagram’s algorithmic systems are told by Instagram that this simply isn’t true. Given the inscrutability of these proprietary algorithmic systems, it is impossible for influencers to convincingly dispute Instagram’s claims. Kelley Cotter refers to this as a form of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1994624">“black box gaslighting”</a>: platforms can “leverage perceptions of their epistemic authority on their algorithms to undermine users’ confidence in what they know about algorithms and destabilise credible criticism.” Her interviews with influencers give voice to stakeholder concerns and perspectives that are elided in Instagram’s official narrative about its systems. The mismatch between different stakeholders’ accounts of ‘reality’ is instructive. For example, a widely-cited paper by Netflix employees claims that Netflix recommendation <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2843948">“influences choice for about 80% of hours streamed at Netflix.”</a> But this claim stands in stark contrast to Mattias Frey’s mixed-methods research (representative survey plus small sample for interviews) run with UK and US adults, in which <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520382046/netflix-recommends#:~:text=Netflix%20Recommends%20brings%20to%20light,critics%20is%20stronger%20than%20ever.">less than 1 in 5 adults said they primarily relied on Netflix recommendations</a> when deciding what films to watch. Even if this is because users underestimate their reliance on recommender systems, that’s a critically important finding - particularly when we’re trying to regulate recommendation and so many are advocating providing better user-level controls as a check on platform power. Are people really going to go to the trouble of changing their settings if they don’t think they rely on algorithmic suggestions that much anyway?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qualitative-research-sheds-light-on-the-context-of-data-annotation">Qualitative research sheds light on the context of data annotation</h2>
<p>Machine learning systems rely on vast amounts of data. In many cases, for that data to be useful, it needs to be labelled/ annotated. For example, a hate speech classifier (an AI-enabled tool used to identify and flag potential cases of hate speech on a website) relies on huge datasets of text labelled as ‘hate speech’ or ‘not hate speech’ to ‘learn’ how to spot hate speech. But it turns out that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04554"><em>who</em> is doing the annotating and in <em>what context</em> they’re doing it, matters</a>. AI-powered content moderation is often held up as the solution to harmful content online. What has continued to be underplayed is the extent to which those automated systems are and most likely will remain dependent on the manual work of human content moderators sifting through some of the worst and most traumatic online material to power the machine learning datasets on which automated content moderation depends. Emily Denton and her colleagues highlight the significance of annotators’ social identity (e.g., race, gender) and their expertise when it comes to annotation tasks, and they point out the risks associated with overlooking these factors and simply ‘aggregating’ results as ‘ground truth’ rather than properly exploring disagreements between annotators and the important insights that this kind of disagreement might offer.</p>
<p>Human commercial content moderators (such as the people that identify and remove violent and traumatic imagery on Facebook) often labour in terrible conditions, lacking psychological support or appropriate financial compensation. The <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300261479/behind-the-screen/">interview-based research of Sarah T. Roberts</a> has been pioneering in highlighting these conditions. Most demand for crowdsourced digital labour comes from the Global North, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1024258916687250">yet the majority of these workers</a> are based in the Global South and receive low wages. Semi-structured interviews reveal the extent to which workers feel unable to bargain effectively for better pay in the current regulatory environment. As Mark Graham and his colleagues point out, these findings are hugely important in a context where several governments and supranational development organisations like the World Bank are holding up digital work as a promising tool to fight poverty.</p>
<p>The decision of how to measure ‘race’ in machine learning systems is highly consequential, especially in the context of existing efforts to evaluate these systems for their “fairness.” Alex Hanna, Emily Denton, Andrew Smart and Jamila Smith-Loud have done <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3372826">crucial work highlighting the limitation</a> of machine learning systems that rely on official records of race or their proxies (e.g.&nbsp;census records), noting that the racial categories provided by such records are “unstable, contingent, and rooted in racial inequality.” The authors emphasise the importance of conducting research in ways that prioritise the perspectives of the marginalised racial communities that fairness metrics are supposed to protect. Qualitative research is ideally placed to contribute to a consideration of “race” in machine learning systems that is grounded in the lived experiences and needs of the racially subjugated.</p>

<section id="what-next" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-next">What next?</h2>
<p>Collaborations between quantitative and qualitative researchers are valuable in understanding AI ethics from all angles.</p>
<p>Consider reading more broadly, outside your particular area. Perhaps using the links and researchers listed here as starting points. They’re just a sliver of the wealth that’s out there. You could also check out the <a href="https://socialmediacollective.org/reading-lists/critical-algorithm-studies/">Social Media Collective’s Critical Algorithm Studies reading list</a>, the reading list provided by the <a href="https://zoeglatt.com/?page_id=545">LSE Digital Ethnography Collective</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/fair-bytes/reading-list-for-fairness-in-ai-topics-337e8606fd8d">Catherine Yeo’s suggestions</a>.</p>
<p>Strike up conversations with researchers in other fields, and consider the possibility of collaborations. Find a researcher slightly outside your field but whose work you broadly understand and like, and follow them on Twitter. With any luck, they will share more of their work and help you identify other researchers to follow. Collaboration can be an incremental process: Consider inviting the researcher to form part of a discussion panel, reach out to say what you liked and appreciated about their work and why, and share your own work with them if you think it’s aligned with their interests.</p>
<p>Within your university or company, is there anything you could do to better reward or facilitate interdisciplinary work? As Humanities Computing Professor <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03080188.2022.2031659">Willard McCarty notes</a>, somewhat discouragingly, “professional reward for genuinely interdisciplinary research is rare.” To be sure, individual researchers and practitioners have to be prepared <a href="https://sciencetechnologystudies.journal.fi/article/view/97321/56310">to put themselves out there, compromise</a> and <a href="https://www.mccarty.org.uk/essays/McCarty,%20Becoming%20interdisciplinary.pdf">challenge themselves</a> - but carefully tailored <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ijmr.12016?casa_token=9f4Qosl_MLEAAAAA%3AMFozyMi171KgZ-BYQrpS-1bK71gt70I4ecjy8lLId54-2zvTobqCGKIK_-9_hEk8-wI5vMR0Em5-">institutional incentives and enablers matter</a>.</p>

  <title>AI Harms are Societal, Not Just Individual</title>

<section id="not-just-individual-but-societal-harms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="not-just-individual-but-societal-harms">Not just Individual, but Societal Harms</h2>
<p>When the USA government switched to facial identification service ID.me for unemployment benefits, the software <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2021/07/07/colorado-unemployment-idme-glitch-internet-access/">failed to recognize Bill Baine’s face</a>. While the app said that he could have a virtual appointment to be verified instead, he was unable to get through. The screen had a wait time of 2 hours and 47 minutes that never updated, even over the course of weeks. He tried calling various offices, his daughter drove in from out of town to spend a day helping him, and yet he was never able to get a useful human answer on what he was supposed to do, as he went for months without unemployment benefits. In Baine’s case, it was eventually resolved when a journalist hypothesized that the issue was a spotty internet connection, and that Baine would be better off traveling to another town to use a public library computer and internet. Even then, it still took hours for Baine to get his approval.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Journalist Andrew Kenney of Colorado Public Radio has covered the issues with ID.me</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Baine was not alone. The number of people receiving unemployment benefits plummeted by 40% in the 3 weeks after ID.me was introduced. Some of these were presumed to be fraudsters, but it is unclear how many genuine people in need of benefits were wrongly harmed by this. These are individual harms, but there are broader, societal harms as well: the cumulative costs of the public having to spend ever more time on hold, trying to navigate user-hostile automated bureaucracies where they can’t get the answers they need. There is the societal cost of greater inequality and greater desperation, as more people are plunged into poverty through erroneous denial of benefits. And there is the undermining of trust in public services, which can be difficult to restore.</p>
<p><a href="https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FPF-Automated-Decision-Making-Harms-and-Mitigation-Charts.pdf">Potential for algorithmic harm</a> takes many forms: loss of opportunity (employment or housing discrimination), economic cost (credit discrimination, narrowed choices), social detriment (stereotype confirmation, dignitary harms), and loss of liberty (increased surveillance, disproportionate incarceration). And each of these four categories manifests in both individual and societal harms.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that algorithmic systems can give rise to societal harm. These systems are sociotechnical: they are designed by humans and teams that bring their values to the design process, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921000155">algorithmic systems continually draw information from, and inevitably bear the marks of, fundamentally unequal, unjust societies</a>. In the context of COVID-19, for example, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n304">policy experts warned</a> that historical healthcare inequities risked making their way into the datasets and models being used to predict and respond to the pandemic. And while it’s intuitively appealing to think of large-scale systems as creating the greatest risk of societal harm, algorithmic systems can create societal harm because of the <a href="https://cerre.eu/publications/what-is-the-harm-in-size/">dynamics set off by their interconnection with other systems/ players</a>, like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00358-3">advertisers</a>, or commercially-driven media, and the ways in which they touch on sectors or spaces of public importance.</p>
<p>Still, in the west, our ideas of harm are often anchored to an individual being harmed <a href="https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/beyond-individual-governing-ais-societal-harm">by a particular action at a discrete moment in time</a>. As law scholar Natalie Smuha has powerfully argued, legislation (both proposed and passed) in Western countries to address algorithmic risks and harms often focuses on individual rights: regarding how an individual’s data is collected or stored, to not be discriminated against, or to know when AI is being used. Even metrics used to evaluate the fairness of algorithms are often aggregating across individual impacts, but unable to capture longer-term, more complex, or second- and third-order societal impacts.</p>

<section id="case-study-privacy-and-surveillance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-privacy-and-surveillance">Case Study: Privacy and surveillance</h2>
<p>Consider the over-reliance on individual harms in discussing privacy: so often focused on whether individual users have the ability to opt in or out of sharing their data, notions of individual consent, or proposals that individuals be paid for their personal data. Yet widespread surveillance fundamentally changes society: people may begin to self-censor and to be less willing (or able) to advocate for justice or social change. Professor Alvaro Bedoya, director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3599201">traces a history</a> of how surveillance has been used by the state to try to shut down movements for progress– targeting religious minorities, poor people, people of color, immigrants, sex workers and those considered “other”. <a href="https://idlewords.com/2019/06/the_new_wilderness.htm">As Maciej Ceglowski</a> writes, “Ambient privacy is not a property of people, or of their data, but of the world around us… Because our laws frame privacy as an individual right, we don’t have a mechanism for deciding whether we want to live in a surveillance society.”</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01168">Drawing on interviews with African data experts</a>, Birhane et al write that even when data is anonymized and aggregated, it “can reveal information on the community as a whole. While notions of privacy often focus on the individual, there is growing awareness that collective identity is also important within many African communities, and that sharing aggregate information about communities can also be regarded as a privacy violation.” Recent US-based scholarship has also highlighted the importance of thinking about <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-82786-1_6">group level privacy</a> (whether that group is made up of individuals who identify as members of that group, or whether it’s a ‘group’ that is algorithmically determined - like individuals with similar shopping habits on Amazon). Because even aggregated anonymised data can reveal important group-level information (e.g., the location of military personnel training via exercise tracking apps) “managing privacy”, these authors argue “is often not intrapersonal but interpersonal.” And yet legal and tech design privacy solutions are often better geared towards assuring individual-level privacy than negotiating group privacy.</p>

<section id="case-study-disinformation-and-erosion-of-trust" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-disinformation-and-erosion-of-trust">Case Study: Disinformation and erosion of trust</h2>
<p>Another example of a collective societal harm comes from how technology platforms such as Facebook have played a significant role in elections ranging from the Philippines to Brazil, yet it can be difficult (and not necessarily possible or useful) to quantify exactly how much: something as complex as a country’s political system and participation involves many interlinking factors. But when ‘deep fakes’ make it <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/calr107&amp;i=1789">“possible to create audio and video of real people saying and doing things they never said or did”</a> or when motivated actors successfully <a href="https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/disinformation-optimised-gaming-search-engine-algorithms-amplify-junk-news">game search engines to amplify disinformation</a>, the (potential) harm that is generated is societal, not just individual. Disinformation and the undermining of trust in institutions and fellow citizens have broad impacts, including on individuals who never use social media.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2022-05-17-societal-harms/disinfo-headlines.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:60.0%"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Reports and Events on Regulatory Approaches to Disinformation</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Efforts by national governments to deal with the problem through regulation have not gone down well with everyone. ‘Disinformation’ has repeatedly been highlighted as one of the tech-enabled ‘societal harms’ that the UK’s Online Safety Bill or the EU’s Digital Services Act should address, and a range of governments are taking aim at the problem by proposing or passing a slew of (in certain cases ill-advised) <a href="https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/anti-misinformation-actions/">‘anti-misinformation’ laws</a>. But there’s widespread unease around handing power to governments to set standards for what counts as ‘disinformation’. Does reifying ‘disinformation’ as a societal harm become a legitimizing tool for governments looking to silence political dissent or undermine their weaker opponents? It’s a fair and important concern - and yet simply leaving that power in the hands of mostly US-based, unaccountable tech companies is hardly a solution. What are the <a href="https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/event/national-approaches-online-harms-regulation/">legitimacy implications if a US company like Twitter were to ban</a> democratically elected Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for spreading disinformation, for example? How do we ensure that tech companies are investing sufficiently in <a href="https://law.yale.edu/isp/initiatives/wikimedia-initiative-intermediaries-and-information/wiii-blog/moderate-globally-impact-locally-series-content-moderation-global-south">governance efforts across the globe</a>, rather than responding in an ad hoc manner to proximal (i.e.&nbsp;mostly US-based) concerns about disinformation? Taking a hands off approach to platform regulation doesn’t make platforms’ efforts to deal with disinformation any less politically fraught.</p>
</section>
<section id="individual-harms-individual-solutions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-harms-individual-solutions">Individual Harms, Individual Solutions</h2>
<p>If we consider individual solutions our only option (in terms of policy, law, or behavior), we often limit the scope of the harms we can recognize or the nature of the problems we face. To take an example not related to AI: Oxford professor Trish Greenhalgh et al <a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/316109/articles/545687-how-covid-19-spreads-narratives-counter-narratives-and-social-dramas">analyzed the slow reluctance</a> of leaders in the West to accept that covid is airborne (e.g.&nbsp;it can linger and float in the air, similar to cigarette smoke, requiring masks and ventilation to address), rather than droplet dogma (e.g.&nbsp;washing your hands is a key precaution). One reason they highlight is the Western framing of individual responsibility as the solution to most problems. Hand-washing is a solution that fits the idea of individual responsibility, whereas collective responsibility for the quality of shared indoor air does not. The allowable set of solutions helps shape what we identify as a problem. Additionally, the fact that recent research suggests that “the level of interpersonal trust in a society” was a strong predictor of which countries managed COVID-19 most successfully should give us pause. Individualistic framings can limit our imagination about the problems we face and which solutions are likely to be most impactful.</p>

<section id="parallels-with-environmental-harms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parallels-with-environmental-harms">Parallels with Environmental Harms</h2>
<p>Before the passage of environmental laws, many existing legal frameworks were not well-suited to address environmental harms. Perhaps a chemical plant releases waste emissions into the air once per week. Many people in surrounding areas may not be aware that they are breathing polluted air, or may not be able to directly link air pollution to a new medical condition, such as asthma, (which could be related to a variety of environmental and genetic factors).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2022-05-17-societal-harms/air-pollution.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:60.0%"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">There are parallels between air polllution and algorithmic harms</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There are many parallels between environmental issues and AI ethics. Environmental harms include individual harms for people who develop discrete health issues from drinking contaminated water or breathing polluted air. Yet, environmental harms are also societal: the societal costs of contaminated water and polluted air can reverberate in subtle, surprising, and far-reaching ways. As law professor Nathalie Smuha writes, <a href="https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/beyond-individual-governing-ais-societal-harm">environmental harms are often accumulative and build over time</a>. Perhaps each individual release of waste chemicals from a refinery has little impact on its own, but adds up to be significant. In the EU, environmental law allows for mechanisms to show societal harm, as it would be difficult to challenge many environmental harms on the basis of individual rights. Smuha argues that there are many similarities with AI ethics: for opaque AI systems, spanning over time, it can be difficult to prove a direct causal relationship to societal harm.</p>

<section id="directions-forward" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="directions-forward">Directions Forward</h2>
<p>To a large extent our message is to tech companies and policymakers. It’s not enough to focus on the potential individual harms generated by tech and AI: the broader societal costs of tech and AI matter.</p>
<p>But those of us outside tech policy circles have a crucial role to play. One way in which we can guard against the risks of the ‘societal harm’ discourse being co-opted by those with political power to legitimise undue interference and further entrench their power is by claiming the language of ‘societal harm’ as the democratic and democratising tool it can be. We all lose when we pretend societal harms don’t exist, or when we acknowledge they exist but throw our hands up. And those with the least power, like Bill Baine, are likely to suffer a disproportionate loss.</p>
<p>In his newsletter on Tech and Society, L.M. Sacasas encourages people to ask themselves <a href="https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/the-questions-concerning-technology?">41 questions before using a particular technology</a>. They’re all worth reading and thinking about - but we’re listing a few especially relevant ones to get you started. Next time you sit down to log onto social media, order food online, swipe right on a dating app or consider buying a VR headset, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does this technology empower me? At whose expense? (Q16)</li>
<li>What feelings does the use of this technology generate in me toward others? (Q17)</li>
<li>What limits does my use of this technology impose upon others? (Q28)</li>
<li>What would the world be like if everyone used this technology exactly as I use it? (Q37)</li>
<li>Does my use of this technology make it easier to live as if I had no responsibilities toward my neighbor? (Q40)</li>
<li>Can I be held responsible for the actions which this technology empowers? Would I feel better if I couldn’t? (Q41)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s on all of us to sensitise ourselves to the societal implications of the tech we use.</p>

  <title>There’s no such thing as not a math person</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>On the surface, I may seem into math: I have a math PhD, taught a graduate <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2017/07/17/num-lin-alg/">computational linear algebra</a> course, co-founded AI research lab <a href="https://www.fast.ai/about/">fast.ai</a>, and even go by the twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/math_rachel"><span class="citation" data-cites="math_rachel">@math_rachel</span></a>.</p>
<p>Yet many of my experiences of academic math culture have been toxic, sexist, and deeply alienating. At my lowest points, I felt like there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqjP7O9SxOM&amp;list=PLtmWHNX-gukLQlMvtRJ19s7-8MrnRV6h6">no place for me</a> in math academia or math-heavy tech culture.</p>
<p>It is not just mathematicians or math majors who are impacted by this: Western culture is awash in negative feelings and experiences regarding math, which permate from many sources and impact students of all ages. In this post, I will explore the cultural factors, misconceptions, stereotypes, and relevant studies on obstacles that turn people off to math. If you (or your child) doesn’t like math or feels anxious about your own capabilities, you’re not alone, and this isn’t just a personal challenge. The below essay is based on part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmA8-vYwjM0&amp;list=PLtmWHNX-gukLQlMvtRJ19s7-8MrnRV6h6&amp;index=8">a talk</a> I recently gave.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="myth-of-innate-ability-myth-of-the-lone-genius">Myth of Innate Ability, Myth of the Lone Genius</h2>
<p>One common myth is the idea that certain people’s brains aren’t “wired” the right way to do math, tech, or AI, that your brain either “works that way” or not. None of the evidence supports this viewpoint, yet when people believe this, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Dr.&nbsp;Omoju Miller, who earned her PhD at UC Berkeley and was a senior machine learning engineer and technical advisor to the CEO at Github, shares some of the research debunking the myth of innate ability in <a href="http://omojumiller.com/articles/The-Myth-Of-Innate-Ability-In-">this essay</a> and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFWVHSeakkg">her TEDx talk</a>. In reality, there is no such thing as “not a math person.”</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Cathy O’Neil, a Harvard Math PhD and author of <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/weapons-of-math-destruction-9780141985411">Weapons of Math Destruction</a>, wrote about the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-06-07/a-mathematician-s-secret-we-re-not-all-geniuses">myth of the lone genius mathematician</a>, <em>“You don’t have to be a genius to become a mathematician. If you find this statement at all surprising, you’re an example of what’s wrong with the way our society identifies, encourages and rewards talent… For each certified genius, there are at least a hundred great people who helped achieve such outstanding results.”</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="music-without-singing-or-instruments">Music without singing or instruments</h2>
<p>Imagine a world where children are not allowed to sing songs or play instruments until they reach adulthood, after spending a decade or two transcribing sheet music by hand. This scenario is absurd and nightmarish, yet it is analogous to how math is often taught, with the most creative and interesting parts saved until almost everyone has dropped out. Dr.&nbsp;Paul Lockhart eloquently describes this metaphor in his essay, <a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">A Mathematician’s Lament</a>, on <em>“how school cheats us out of our most fascinating and imaginative art form.”</em> Dr.&nbsp;Lockhart left his role as a university math professor to teach K-12 math, as he felt that so much reform was needed in how math is taught.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;David Perkins uses the analogy of how children can play baseball wthout knowing all the technical details, without having a full team or playing a full 9 innings, yet still gain a sense of the <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Making_Learning_Whole.html?id=0DF9WxgGgNsC">“whole game.”</a> Math is usually taught with an overemphasis on dry, technical details, without giving students a concept of the “whole game.” It can take years and years before enough technical details are accumulated to build something interesting. There is an overemphasis on techniques rather than meaning.</p>

</div>
<p>Math curriculums are usually arranged in a vertical manner, with each year building tightly on the previous, such that one bad year can ruin everything that comes after. Many people I talk to can pinpoint the year that math went bad for them: <em>“I used to like math until 6th grade, when I had a bad teacher/was dealing with peer pressure/my undiagnosed ADHD was out of control. After that, I was never able to succeed in future years.”</em> This is less true in other subjects, where one bad history teacher/one bad year doesn’t mean that you can’t succeed at history the following year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836676/">Female teachers’ math anxiety affects girls’ math achievement</a>: In the USA, over 90% of primary school teachers are female, and research has found <em>“the more anxious teachers were about math, the more likely girls (but not boys) were to endorse the commonly held stereotype that ‘boys are good at math, and girls are good at reading’ and the lower these girls’ math achievement… People’s fear and anxiety about doing math—over and above actual math ability—can be an impediment to their math achievement.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/opinion/how-to-attract-female-engineers.html">Research</a> across a number of universities has found that more women go into engineering when courses focus on problems with positive social impact.</p>
<p>Structural racism also impacts what messages teachers impart to students. An Atlantic article <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/racist-math-education/524199/">How Does Race Affect a Student’s Math Education?</a> covered the research paper <a href="https://journals.tdl.org/jume/index.php/JUME/article/view/294">A Framework for Understanding Whiteness in Mathematics Education</a>, noting that <em>“Constantly reading and hearing about underperforming Black, Latino, and Indigenous students begins to embed itself into how math teachers view these students, attributing achievement differences to their innate ability to succeed in math… teachers start to expect worse performance from certain students, start to teach lower content, and start to use lower-level math instructional practices. By contrast, white and Asian students are given the benefit of the doubt and automatically afforded the opportunity to do more sophisticated and substantive mathematics.”</em></p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Piper Harron made waves with her <a href="http://www.theliberatedmathematician.com/thesis/">Princeton PhD thesis</a>, utilizing humor, analogies, sarcasm, and genuine efforts to be accessible as she described advanced concepts in a ground-breaking way, very atypical for a mathematics PhD thesis. Dr.&nbsp;Harron wrote openly in the prologue of her thesis on how alienating the culture of mathematics is, <em>“As any good grad student would do, I tried to fit in, mathematically. I absorbed the atmosphere and took attitudes to heart. I was miserable, and on the verge of failure. The problem was not individuals, but a system of self-preservation that, from the outside, feels like a long string of betrayals, some big, some small, perpetrated by your only support system.”</em> At her blog, the Liberated Mathematician, <a href="http://www.theliberatedmathematician.com/">she writes</a>, <em>“My view of mathematics is that it is an absolute mess which actively pushes out the sort of people who might make it better.”</em></p>
<p>These descriptions resonate with my own experiences obtaining a math PhD (as well as the experiences of many friends, at a variety of universities). The toxicity of academic math departments is self-perpetuating, pushing out the people who could make them better.</p>

  <title>Avoiding Data Disasters</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Things can go disastrously wrong in data science and machine learning projects when we undervalue data work, use data in contexts that it wasn’t gathered for, or ignore the crucial role that humans play in the data science pipeline. A new multi-university <a href="https://cires.org.au/">centre focused on Information Resilience</a>, funded by the Australian government’s top scientific funding body (ARC), has recently launched. <strong>Information Resilience</strong> is the capacity to detect and respond to failures and risks across the information chain in which data is sourced, shared, transformed, analysed, and consumed. I’m honored to be a member of the strategy board, and I have been thinking about what information resilience means with respect to data practices. Through a series of case studies and relevant research papers, I will highlight these risks and point towards more resilient practices.</p>
<section id="case-study-uk-covid-tracking-app" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-uk-covid-tracking-app">Case study: UK covid tracking app</h2>
<p>Data from a covid-symptom tracking app was used in a research paper to draw <a href="https://twitter.com/ahandvanish/status/1313973286364229638?s=20">wildly inaccurate conclusions</a> about the prevalence of Long Covid, the often debilitating neurological, vascular, and immune disease that can last for months or longer (some patients have been sick for 20 months and counting). The app suggested that only 1.5% of patients still experience symptoms after 3 months, an order of magnitude smaller than estimates of 10-35% being found by other studies.</p>
<p>How could this research project have gone so wrong? Well, the app had been designed for a completely different purpose (tracking 1-2 week long respiratory infections), didn’t include the most common Long Covid symptoms (such as neurological dysfunction), had a frustrating user-interface that led many patients to quit using it, and made the erroneous assumption that those who stopped logging must be fully recovered. The results from this faulty research paper were widely shared, including in a BBC article, offering false reassurance than Long Covid prevalence is much rarer than it is. Patients had been voicing their frustrations with the app all along, and if researchers had listened sooner, they could have collected a much higher quality and more accurate data set.</p>
<p>This research failure illustrates a few common issues in data projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>context of the data</strong> was not taken into account. The user-interface, the categories listed, the included features– these were all designed to record data about a short-term mild respiratory infection. However, when it was used for a different purpose (long covid patients suffering for months with vascular and neurological symptoms), it did a poor job, and led to missing and incomplete data. This happens all too often, in which data gathered for one context is used for another</li>
<li>The <strong>people most impacted</strong> (long covid patients) were ignored. They had the most accurate expertise on what long covid actually entailed, yet were not listened to. Ignoring this expertise led to lower quality data and erroneous research conclusions. Patients have <a href="https://bostonreview.net/science-nature/rachel-thomas-medicines-machine-learning-problem">crucial domain expertise</a>, which is distinct from that of doctors, and must be included in medical data science projects. From the start of the pandemic, patients who had suffered from other debilitating post-viral illnesses warned that we should be on the lookout for long-term illness, even in initially “mild” cases.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="data-is-crucial" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-is-crucial">Data is Crucial</h2>
<p>Collecting data about covid and its long-term effects directly from patients was a good idea, but poorly executed in this case. Due to <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/08/07/surveillance/">privacy and surveillance risks</a>, I frequently remind people not to record data that they don’t need. However, the pandemic has been a good reminder of how much data we really do need, and how tough it is when it’s missing.</p>
<p>At the start of the pandemic in the United States, we had very little data about what was happening– the government was not tabulating information on cases, testing, or hospitalization. How could we know how to react when we didn’t understand how many cases there were, what death rates were, how transmissible the disease was, and other crucial information? How could we make policy decisions in the absence of a basic understanding of the facts.</p>
<p>In early March 2020, two journalists and a data scientist from a medication-discovery platform began <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_profile/covid-tracking-project.php">pulling covid data together</a> into a spreadsheet to understand the situation in the USA. This launched into a <a href="https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/why-we-didnt-automate-our-data-collection">15-month long project in which 500 volunteers</a> compiled and published data on COVID-19 testing, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the USA. During those 15 months, the Covid Tracking Project was the most comprehensive source of covid data in the USA, even more comprehensive than what the CDC had, and it was used by the CDC, numerous government agencies, and both the Trump and Biden Administrations. It was cited in academic studies and in thousands of news articles.</p>

</div>
<p>A data infrastructure engineer and contributor for the project <a href="https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/why-we-didnt-automate-our-data-collection">later recounted</a>, “It quickly became apparent that daily, close contact with the data was necessary to understand what states were reporting. States frequently changed how, what, and where they reported data. Had we set up a fully automated data capture system in March 2020, it would have failed within days.” The project used automation as a way to support and supplement manual work, not to replace it. At numerous points, errors in state reporting mechanisms were caught by eagle-eyed data scientists notifying discrepancies.</p>
<p>This vision of using automation to support human work resonates with our interest at fast.ai in “augmentedML”, not “autoML”. I have <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/16/auto-ml2/">written previously</a> and <a href="https://slideslive.com/38917533/lessons-learned-from-helping-200000-nonml-experts-use-ml">gave an AutoML workshop keynote</a> on how too often automation ignores the important role of human input. Rather than try to automate everything (which often fails), we should focus on how humans and machines can best work together to take advantage of their different strengths.</p>

<section id="data-work-is-undervalued" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-work-is-undervalued">Data Work is Undervalued</h2>
<p>Interviews of 53 AI practitioners across 6 countries on 3 continents found a pattern that is very familiar to many of us (including me) who work in machine learning: <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub49953/">“Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work.”</a> Missing meta-data leads to faulty assumptions. Data collection practices often conflict with the workflows of on-the-ground partners, such as nurses or farmers, who are usually not compensated for this extraneous effort. Too often data work is arduous, invisible, and taken for granted. Undervaluing of data work leads to poor practices and often results in negative, downstream events, including dangerously inaccurate models and months of lost work.</p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, data about covid (both initial cases and long covid) has often been lacking. Many countries have experienced testing shortages, leading to undercounts of how many people have covid. The <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-cdc-only-tracks-a-fraction-of-breakthrough-covid-19-infections-even-as-cases-surge">CDC decision not to track breakthrough cases</a> unless they resulted in hospitalization made it harder to understand prevalence of break-throughs (a particularly concerning decision since break-throughs can still lead to long covid). In September, it was revealed that British Columbia, Canada was <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/secrecy-over-b-c-s-true-number-of-hospitalized-covid-19-patients-1.5595394">not including covid patients in their ICU counts</a> once the patients were no longer infectious, a secretive decision that obscured how full ICUs were. Some studies of Long Covid have failed to include common symptoms, such as neurological ones, making it harder to understand the prevalence or nature.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-has-context" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-has-context">Data has Context</h2>
<p>Covid is giving us a first-hand view of how data, which we may sometimes want to think of as “objective”, are shaped by countless human decisions and factors. In the example of the symptom tracking app, decisions about which symptoms were included had a significant impact on the prevalence rate calculated. Design decisions that influenced the ease of use impacted how much data was gathered. Lack of understanding of how the app was being used (and why people quit using it) led to erroneous decisions about which cases should be considered “recovered”. These are all examples of the context for data. Here, the data gathered was reasonably appropriate for understanding initial covid infections (a week or two of respiratory symptoms), but not for patients experiencing months of neurological and vascular symptoms. Numbers can not stand alone, we need to understand how they were measured, who was included and excluded, relevant design decisions, under what situations a dataset is appropriate to use vs.&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>As another example, consider covid testing counts: Who has access to testing (this involves health inequities, due to race or urban vs.&nbsp;rural), who is encouraged to get tested (at various times, people without symptoms, children, or other groups have been discouraged from doing so), varying accuracies (e.g.&nbsp;PCR tests are less accurate on children, missing almost half of cases that later go on to seroconvert), and making decisions about what counts as a “case” (I know multiple people who had alternating test results: positive, negative, positive, or the reverse– what counts as a positive case?)</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Datasheet for an electrical component. Image from ‘Datasheets for Datasets’</figcaption>

</div>
<p>One proposal for capturing this context is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010">Datasheets for Datasets</a>. Prior to doing her PhD at Stanford in computer vision and then co-leading Google’s AI ethics team, <a href="https://thegradient.pub/the-far-reaching-impacts-of-timnit-gebru/">Dr.&nbsp;Timnit Gebru</a> worked at Apple in circuit design and electrical engineering. In electronics, each component (such as a circuit or transistor) comes with a datasheet that lists when and where it was manufactured, under what conditions it is safe to use, and other specifications. Dr.&nbsp;Gebru drew on this background to propose a similar idea for datasets: listing the context of when and how it was created, what data was included/excluded, recommended uses, potential biases and ethical risks, work needed to maintain it, and so on. This is a valuable proposal towards making the context of data more explicit.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-people-most-impacted" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-people-most-impacted">The People Most Impacted</h2>
<p>The inaccurate research and incomplete data from the covid tracking app could have been avoided by drawing on the expertise of patients. Higher quality data could have been collected sooner and more thoroughly, if patients were consulted in the app design and in the related research studies. Participatory approaches to machine learning is an exciting and growing area of research. In any domain, the people who would be most impacted by errors or mistakes need to be included as partners in the design of the project.</p>

<p>Often, our approaches to addressing fairness or other ethics issues, further centralize the power of system designers and operators. The organizers of an ICML workshop on the topic called <a href="https://participatoryml.github.io/">for more cooperative, democratic, and participatory</a> approaches instead. We need to think not just about <strong>explainability</strong>, but about giving people <strong>actionable recourse</strong>. As <a href="https://slideslive.com/38930604/actionable-recourse-in-machine-learning">Professor Berk Ustun highlights</a>, when someone asks why their loan was denied, usually what they want is not just an explanation but to know what they could change in order to get a loan. We need to design systems with <a href="http://contestability.org/"><strong>contestability</strong></a> in mind, to include from the start the idea that people should be able to challenge system outputs. We need to include <a href="https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/project/diverse-voices/">expert panels of perspectives</a> that are often overlooked, depending on the application, this could mean formerly or currently incarcerated people, people who don’t drive, people with very low incomes, disabled people, and many others. <a href="https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/project/diverse-voices/">The Diverse Voices project</a> from University of Washington Tech Lab provides guidance on how to do this. And it is crucial that this not just be tokenistic <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/25/1007589/participation-washing-ai-trends-opinion-machine-learning/">participation-washing</a>, but a meaningful, appropriately compensated, and ongoing role in their design and operation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="towards-greater-data-resilience">Towards Greater Data Resilience</h2>
<p>I hope that we can improve data resilience through: - Valuing data work - Documenting context of data - Close contact with the data - Meaningful, ongoing, and compensated involvement of the people impacted</p>
<p>And I hope that when our data represents people we can remember the human side. As <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296309/">AI researcher Inioluwa Deborah Raji wrote</a>, “Data are not bricks to be stacked, oil to be drilled, gold to be mined, opportunities to be harvested. Data are humans to be seen, maybe loved, hopefully taken care of.”</p>
